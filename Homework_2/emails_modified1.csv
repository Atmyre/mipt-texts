AMAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.By Anne-Marie SlaughterPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it istightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering andsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zonewhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the ArabLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the UnitedStates"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region,"" they arealready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arabpopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about ourprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a newbeginning in the Muslim world — a new beginning of aountable governments that can provideservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support forterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's directorgeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is comingfrom Arabs themselves.  this perspective, Western military intervention will play right intoQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. Butthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan oppositionfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone bysome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter offoreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition thatincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arabdemocrats. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.It won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo . Daaider, argues that stoppingColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks andhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potentialeffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations abouthis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that althoughColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and politicalmanipulator for 40 years. e is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing hismilitary campaign aordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategicadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up againsthim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew hisoffer of a negotiated departure.If it does work, we don't know what we will get. volutions are almost always followed by internaldivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choiceis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region willconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres theopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to supporttheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could'better aomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, ofcourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise betweenthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance toparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but toragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They needaction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafiwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne andmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan oppositionwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon aspossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble aninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we shouldrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France hasdone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests: of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

And the creation of an anti-Islamic video(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst(or excuse) for the protests.Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet MohammedMost Americans operate by a different ""we.""  our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardlyattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""Icondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and freepeople everywhere.""""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on theInternet,"" Secretary of State illary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort todenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginningof our nation.""In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as""This Is Water,"" novelist DavidFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center ofthe world.This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism andfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" — tobegin to see things from the perspectives of others.Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Wallace focused in his speech on the individual ""I."" But his critique can be applied as well to another ""defaultsetting"" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective ofGive:5Aording to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican.Moreover, aording to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individualAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before theprotests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religiousfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest storiesMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in somegroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers asdupes.Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himselfas ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech andreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense thanoffending them with an ignorant movie.Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians andindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.The real ""red line"" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recentdays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers ofinnocents in Libya and Egypt.Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity andcontradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did notknow everything.They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts ofordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroyingthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocenceof Islam.""The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services havebeen unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for FrenchPresident Nicolas Sarkozy, who, aording to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emergefrom this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan FightingGroups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.Aordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terroristgroups have inside of the NLC.

On , 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting hisresponsibilities as commander-in-chief."" e went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libyaendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weaknesswhen we need to be projecting strength.""Similarly, former New York or Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful whobecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""Thisis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be themost transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind ofcover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of fourAmericans.""Giuliani added that the Obama White ouse wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because itseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have thisnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalistterrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declarethis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their veryconvenient narrative.""Likewise, Bob Corker, publican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on ,  30, both Mitt Romney andvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best tokeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expecttransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who aresaying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers weredivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. Oneunnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board —domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" hesaid. ""e's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy asthe central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economicprospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do thatnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of  — and he's failed.

57,58,33,0,0.0,10,0,0,0,"This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle Eaststore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the MuslimBrotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, allthe while promising to annihilate Israel.These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere ""bumps in the road."" They are major issues that put our security at risk.Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people orour allies.And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could bepulled into the maelstrom.We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle EastThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role notthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity throughtrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a ""recovery"" that barely deserves the name. Our nationaldebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White ouse.Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.e does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presentedgrave risks. We needed a strategy for suess, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past fewweeksThe same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating ""daylight"" between our twocountries. e recently downgraded Israel from being our ""closest ally"" in the Middle East to being only ""one of our closest allies."" It's a diplomatic message that willbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. e dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere ""noise"" that he prefers to ""block out."" And at a time whenIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals whoshare our values.This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unaeptable,the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity forthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives toextremism.But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Ofour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

GelbA diplomat under fire.With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperatelysearching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came SusanRice. A couple s ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talkshows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was ""spontaneous""rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was aMormon.Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneousevent. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White ouse had fumbled keyintelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice wasjust covering up for the president. er reward would be Obama's nominating her to sueedillary Clinton as secretary of State.The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to thewall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the publicans in the ouse of presentatives,pledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be theend of Rice's hopes to become the new illary. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice didnot make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White ouse conspirators.She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intelreports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed moreor less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslimfigures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador ChristopherStevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with theinevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.er mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White ouse biiefers madethe same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what theintelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory informationwould appear soon enough. It always does.Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all thecommunications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sortout facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information isnow taking shape.Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along withSenator John Kerry, NSC Adviser m Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, nowof arvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likesher, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatlyinaurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flaggingObama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

We don't considerChris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relationswith Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning inthe direction of the INC.

126,127,76,0,0.0,29,0,0,0,"ere is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear ourview that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to theinvestigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- whattranspired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances."" But she got pushedthere.Waiting on other transcripts.For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. SusanRice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or atthe consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that somepeople involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's thelatest information?RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun andwill take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, whatthis began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. InCairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to thisvery offensive video that was disseminated.We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems tohave been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common andaessible. And it then evolved from there. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER.

NO FOIA WAIVER.We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have atpresent.TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compoundin Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans whowere killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many othercolleagues who were doing the same with them.It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in thatmoment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why thepresident has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on thegovernments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, andwe're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...TAPPER: But why...RICE: ... and where needed.TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked inprevious months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in everyfacility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter ofmonths.But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong securitypresence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is aplace where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the StateDepartment thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whetherwhat was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and willremain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER.

There have been protests around the world over the last severaldays. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why doesthe U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arabcountries than it was four years ago?RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't knowon what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened thisweek in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, thatthe U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we havecondemned it in the strongest possible terms.But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with thegovernments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. Andas soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.President Morsi...TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. e's called off --and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.(CROSSTALK)RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where thegovernment has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for whathas happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in theirrevolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seatedanti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, theoutpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the governmentof Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflectionof the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.TAPPER: That certainly, aording to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since youbrought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was askedabout the relationship with Egypt on , and this is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. Theyare a new government that is trying to find its way.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last fewdecades. And by definition, as you know, aording to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATOally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is avery critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and thepresident wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, thepresident had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscoredthat it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personneland facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramaticsteps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedlymade a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying themessage that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence againstthe United States or other Western partners.So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incrediblymeasured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensuredthat in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have comeout and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan ofTurkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse forviolence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect UnitedStates personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudgePresident Morsi, ""Get your act together""? of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

146,147,88,0,9.0,39,0,0,0,"Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: ere in Benghazi since , I have joined ourrepresentative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UNorganizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significantmilitary advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" thetiming gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-upactivity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recentlypromoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather thanthe authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans forTripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurelymanner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNCjust issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants aording to the Geneva conventions and observe humanrights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forwardthinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does notWhile there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to havetranslated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly twohours on , TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather thanhead any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearancehere. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripolifall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all aounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think ofhow to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, dothe extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance forTripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit tothe military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe supportthere and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for analternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need toremind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuumthat others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be thebest solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promoteand how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, andacts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction evenmore than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibilitycould be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that sueeds in winning Tripoli without a fight wouldunderscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a suessful militia assault only vaguely connected to theBenghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. Theyfeel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up nomatter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us thatthe TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the samecategory as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni alsoacknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak andnot a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself isprepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerillawar could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on thereconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be lesslikely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances throughrule-of-law aountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remainedas part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INCofficials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroan models, and they reiterated their commitment for aninclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they stillseem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as thebest assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigationcommittees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tensionand gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials hadpreviously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials arenow looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting andpillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in . Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balanceto Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC NationalSecurity Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamistleanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of peoplenoted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There waswidespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern herewhen I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase asmore territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated townsor fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians todiscuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed onSouth Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africaproblem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently aused Zuma of makingNelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the  25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule outattending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and theUAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest wayof getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of theU.S. interagency process.My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibrilagain in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's roleapproaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should Ineed to join Chris here in the coming days.Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for allthe work done to support my trip.

SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO memberand partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway andapproved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US effortsboth generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whomtouched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Manymentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own nationalaction plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implementthem. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regionalconflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wantedme to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own peopleboth at NATO and DOD.I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on gettingthe engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.I also met with Vivian dding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boardsof directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women inLibya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went outof their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him.

174,175,104,0,15.0,51,0,0,0,"Associated PressPublished  21, 2012BENGAZI, lli3YA — undreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed thecompound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building.In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of theAnsar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with theirweapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want tosee people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, whichprotesters said was done in support of the army and police.No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armedmilitias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggestproblems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- themultiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than theregular armed forces and police.The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya'srevolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivalsand carrying out killings.Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by theirhardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, whichkilled Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamistmilitia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 werewounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding thatmilitias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?"" of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. STATE-SCB0045425B6 of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER.Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend.""Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of theprotesters.The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall ofQaddafi in  2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has beenunable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueledthe growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.sidents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north ofBenghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of adeadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate andally itself with Al Qaeda.But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslimpreacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radioshow he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain.""Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militiasdisband.Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will nolonger have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they arekilled.Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to putan end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias.Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number ofelderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief andassassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. Inthe ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blareWestern songs.And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's namemeans ""Supporters of Shariah Law.""""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam benMadin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprisingagainst Qaddafi.

""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised overheads,"" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tellthem you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating intothe) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.""Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. Thearmed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.So the government has created a ""igh Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step tointegration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the averagepolice monthly salary of around $200.owever, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has onlyprompted more militias to form.Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil waragainst Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the igh Security Committee payroll have reached severalhundred thousand.""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled adar, a Benghazi-based lawyer.

It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during amajor transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use thisone to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuationwith military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David . Petraeus after an extramarital affaircame to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor ofnon-military approaches.When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under PresidentGeorge W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion wasreflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the mancould offer him.Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents amilitary solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessedwith Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavyapproach.With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concernedabout the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued topay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. is focus as commander of of State   . - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.: 05/13/2015  AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to thispresident: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a militaryanswer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional andcultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and specialops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by thesame old questions: ow many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need toemploy which tactics to defeat the enemy?What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all theother tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic andlegal leverage.Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastatinglack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I wasstunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopulargovernment. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its corefunction: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by thesecretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each dronein the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gainingan intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator atthe helm of the CIA.Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment oftransition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreignpolicy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application.  avail itself of them, the government needs smart,adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must beattracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The deathof Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductiveways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in theregion to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environmentand helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politicallyuntenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint asecretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one thecurrent crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.Sarah Chayes, former special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. of Staff is a resident associate at theCarnegie Endowment and a contributing writer to Opinion.UNCLASSIFarEtiVright 2012, Los Angeles Times of State   . - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.: 05/13/2015  AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences andpledged his government's full cooperation.Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material postedon the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefsof others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countriesaround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya 12, 2012It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel inBenghazi, Libya yesterday.

Thisassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closerties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace CorpsVolunteer in Moroo. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americanson the ground in Benghazi. e risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand tobuild the foundation for a new, free nation. e spent every day since helping to finish the workthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even whenthat meant putting himself in danger.Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

American and Libyan security personnelbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a ForeignService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We arestill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. Wecondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to thefamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives inthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be aforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificingfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold andgenerous nation.In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the lineof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of thistragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teachingEnglish in Moroo. e joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for Americain distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.e arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships withLibya's revolutionaries. e risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build abetter Libya.

They will grow up being proud of theservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, andfinally to Benghazi.The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.day, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? owcould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in acountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when theattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans tosafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned theviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualtyof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will notturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found andbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly andsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other Americanembassies, consulates, and citizens.There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higherpriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determinethe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought tojustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairoyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitmentto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there isno justification for this, none.

Our thoughts, prayers, anddeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on ourcritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone andGlen.Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq andAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts fromCentral America to the Middle East. e had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out toTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., unter, and Kai, who was born just a fewmonths ago.We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his motherBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and anexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor andunstinting valor.We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we aretaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around theworld.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleaguesfrom Moroo here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Departmentfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Moroo Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin toaddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations withMoroo, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope andexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests intoviolence.I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to theseprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that theUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject itscontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the verybeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many ofwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith. us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeplycynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, thereis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn theviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims inthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like otherreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of thatfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing toshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will neverknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed againstdiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote betterunderstuiding across countries and cultures.

Now, I wouldnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it werepossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in ourConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views nomatter how distasteful they may be.There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech andfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence inresponse to speech is not aeptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders incivil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leadershould be standing up now and drawing that line.I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroan friends and all of you know, thishas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, thecondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedyhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morooto the United States. It was in the igh Atlas Mountains of Moroo that one of the Americanswe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as aPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So inthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in whichriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a betterfuture.In many ways, the United States looks to Moroo to be a leader and a model. is Majesty KingMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabatearlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Moroo."" Nocountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Moroo. You were the first nation torecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that islongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let mehighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa andthe Middle East. I commend Moroo and your government for your efforts to stay ahead ofthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking othersteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. day, our political workinggroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translatecommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that peoplethemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroans — men and women alike —respected.I'm especially pleased by Moroo's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem ofchild marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to facelife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not onlyshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So wewant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together onthis issue.With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find apeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara hasremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Moroo's autonomy plan isserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy theaspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. Wecontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can worktoward resolution.With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done todeliver tangible economic benefits. Moroo's economy is relatively healthy, but you face thesame problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especiallyamong young people.That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreigninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'mpleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Moroo business developmentconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.day, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, aparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Moroo goes to Europe. I'd like to increasethe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integrationacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Moroo because of Moroo's stability andMoroo's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater thebenefits for Moroans.Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Throughour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morooalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Moroo for hosting a GlobalCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provideMoroan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we arepartnering to help strengthen Moroo's criminal justice system and law enforcement.There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatlyappreciates the constructive role Moroo is playing on the UN Security Council, especially yoursupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a newdemocratic future for that country. I commend Moroo for offering to host the next ministerialmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closelytogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30thanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.There are more than 5,000 Moroan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, frompreserving Moroo's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope wecan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths toexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the greatchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treatyour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'mconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nationsstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same forthe world.So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, towork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome yourdistinguished delegation.Thank you.

They were good andbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people ofLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts inBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for thesupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in thistragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of ourambassador.Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a verypersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during therevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do tobring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.ligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.atred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and goodwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or Godin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many ofwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this timeUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted onthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message ofthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs ofothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Moroo, said that allprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification forviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak outagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,we expect them not to resort to violence. When indus or Buddhists are subjected to insults totheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The samegoes for all faiths, including Islam. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. STATE-SCB0045483 of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER.When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, ofmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not toresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation tomeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect ofothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. Theyhave withstood offense for centuries. fraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness inone's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future markedby understanding and aeptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge thatwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They willanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commitsa violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, somemountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding andpeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part ofwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing inour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep usmoving forward in a positive direction.So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people aredoing to help shape that better future.Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called GenerationChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And Iasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, tohelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to youtonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these youngleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are buildingan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement whenneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutualunderstanding and respect, one person at a time. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

Our 2012 ours Against ate initiative encouragesyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, youngpeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from adifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, butanother real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but withwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like alltraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into betterunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear fromtonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,frankly, for us who are older as well.Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in theseefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special presentative to Muslim Communities.And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her toppriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud ofmarks at the Transfer of mains Ceremony to onor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya 14, 2012SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of thefour patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies andgentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and ourvalues.  the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences anddeepest gratitude.Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. e was respected as anexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The ague. e enrolledin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind aloving wife eather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds thatSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garnerswho shared his passion.Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multipletours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel indangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. e had the hands of a healer as wellas the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Ourhearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., unter, and Kai, born justa few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

Glen deployed to some of themost dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on theline to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, hismother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, andcolleagues.I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, whoare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gaveus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United Statesin far-flung places. e made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, herisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping thembuild a better country.People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.e was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his senseof fun and that California cool.In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to theUnited States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One youngwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,"" The President of the PalestinianAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letterremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror.""Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen theheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rageand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing todo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it istotally unaeptable.The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for thetyranny of a mob. asonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to doeverything they can to restore security and hold aountable those behind these violent acts. Andwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around theworld.There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of thefundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men tocontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of theState Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, letit be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart ofwhat makes America great and good.So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we willdo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris alwaysdid.

The President of the United States.marks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign lations Patricia Espinosa After TheirMeeting 18, 2012SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me towelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguisheddelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at thehighest levels of each of our governments.Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we aretaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. Thatincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. Andwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those whomurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothingmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At thesame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlighthow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in theworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because theyknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving andsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance todiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friendsas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you canimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment.

And I want to offermy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for theirleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in ourgovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiativerepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminalorganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violentgangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easyway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past nownearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societieswho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation wehave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long timeto come.day, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improvinglaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our borderinfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empoweredcommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in theseand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important oursecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by thesecriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can tosupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnationalproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter ofshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came toMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people aresafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women andgirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign aMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance genderequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productiveconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuablecolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico andthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

So thank you very much.MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killedAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are youconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice tothe Libyans?SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect ourpeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our securityposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bringthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation insideLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremistswho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared totrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to thefuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strongpartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutualrespect.This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, intheir first free elections, moderates were suessful at the polls. But look, there are extremists inall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage inorder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and Americanfacilities.And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremistefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well asto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to putthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally againstviolence, whoever incites it or conducts itAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We supportthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

And I want tounderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region andaround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions thatthey experienced can be realized.And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly aboutsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that oursecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guardforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the securityoutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of  lid', as is done every year, wedid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence hassaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned orimminent.But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the natureof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security butto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in whatwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against everysingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocolsreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.Thank you.marks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty MulianaNatalegawa After Their Meeting 20, 2012SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, towelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever comefrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United Statesand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security toclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the timeof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago.

NO FOIA WAIVER.But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around theworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted fromthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting andreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and hisgovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people andresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage ofthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.day's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one ofour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. day, I'mannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eightA-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement willstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion lastyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supportingeconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alonerepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced halfa trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum ofunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium ChallengeCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to helpmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we areconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economicintegration across the Asia Pacific.Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modemglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program andsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academicexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit theUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic educationprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

The Foreign Minister'spersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China asit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code ofconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violencein Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangularcooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference onwomen's empowerment.We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States andIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the lastfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratictransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. Andonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had betweenus and between our countries.MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al JazeeraEnglish.QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, myquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and theconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish anaountability review board. ave you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are therecertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety ofForeign Service Officers around the world?And related to this, given the political instability and the suesses of the past year and a half, areyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working inthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area ofrumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens feltthat he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humorwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more towhat he allegedly — and I stress that word — said? of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the ouse and the Senate, ina classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, andwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will bejoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretaryof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect ourpeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to theintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on thesuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at thevery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an aountability review board that will bechaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light ofthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countriesdid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we areconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about theinternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, andchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restoresecurity and civil order.And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at workin Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universalrights, of justice and aountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of wherethat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members ofCongress.As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's anybasis for that.QUESTION: Thank you.MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you.

If it's continuing happen, it's —obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What isthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is yourexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? ow IndonesiaGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)program implemented — could be implemented suessfully in Indonesia. Thank you.SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellentcooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the lawenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only thecooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strongstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closedour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what itneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we arecooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: ello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to closetemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been madebased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the UnitedStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended toshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's thekind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of theembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that isactually coordinated as well.But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condonethe — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, becausethat is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations amongstates. So that's our point of departure.At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we havestill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and othersettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateralrelationship as well as regional and global issues.I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. day, we've once againseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turnedviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for theirefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous oasions, the violence we have seen cannotbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we havecertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's atthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsibleleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence andparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their ownextremist ideologies.Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our peopleeverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terroristattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists whomurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protectour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many importantcontributions to the work of our missions.The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is nosecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. Andwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

NO FOIA WAIVER.today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has justreturned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next weekat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals weshare — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to aomplish them.Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensurethe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a commonenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designatedthe aqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of everyavailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called forexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the PakistaniGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to workingwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support asecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And Iwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allowthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.We will discuss the suessful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabadwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace processin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talkwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to buildon these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we willdiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economicopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economicrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract moreprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we'vecreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and mediumsized companies get aess to capital.Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down strongerroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan'shistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supportsPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracysueed in Pakistan. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister fromTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and Iwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the lastweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following theviolent assaults of last .We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama andmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world toaugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closelywith host governments in this effort.As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other internationalagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work onmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejectingviolence and holding violent actors aountable.We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing thesecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justicethose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look forways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughouttheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward tocontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Ourrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment tononviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the firstof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progresshijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.,,encia.

Wealso are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including fromgroups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you dealwith this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be withyou as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of thefuture of Tunisia. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

Peress was aleftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy inWashington. e asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched aninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. e was the Susan Rice of hisday.Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama'sand a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is aused of havingdone - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something moreat work.At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing hisRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemncharge that Rice had lied to the  TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others werewrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Itwas soon taken up by 97 publicans in the ouse who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - apost to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully orincompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a greatdeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles someothers. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potentialsecretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. e is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker whohas, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign lations Committee, of which he ischairman.But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses.

For the mostpart, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.So what is this fuss all about? ice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of uneaseabout Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government'salleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification ofunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of anamorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might bedusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,but much of the time the White ouse has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugeecalamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarnaadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives muchmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. esees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case forintervention, not just say it's too hard to do.The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in thiscase, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to Americanpower, not merely American politics. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

That conclusion is obvious. The""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was notconstructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in , and she told me that it wasn't evenclear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party ouse hasn't been good on meeting requests forembassy security funds).The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulateduring and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who isresponsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack onthe consulate on  11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in acountry of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1e'as the epicenter of the revolution against thegovernment of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.On  22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In  a police colonelbarely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in. A general was assassinated in . Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi buthad defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre ofhardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the sameshadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and armyofficers.There may have been a break in the case. Last , Benghazi security forces loyal to the electedgovernment in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind theviolence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan DeepThroat.Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to thosehatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.On  morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man isbeing detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they calledfor back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect incustody, with all his valuable testimony.Shortly after midnight, on  morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis policestation in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Thenexplosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted incasualties. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if hedid so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, thereis collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. e closed thecountry's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. e may well have some risky housecleaning to do in Benghazi. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Let me know your thoughts:SOURCE: Sources with direct aess to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels ofEuropean Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.1.On  17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a closeadvisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for thegovernment of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. Aording to a source with aess to the NTC leadership, Jalilrealizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technicalexperts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalistmovement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continuesto complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of noconfidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, aording to this source, Jalil is consideringdelaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporaryunderstanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to theNTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regardingwho has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of  16, 2012,no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believesthey can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, aording to asensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalistmovement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil'sopinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib'scabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused securitysituation in Tripoli. owever, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel akim Alamin Belhaj regardingpossible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to theeastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightenedtension between the eastern and western portions of the country. Aording to this source, after reviewing the federalistproblem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, OilMinister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of thissource Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.4. garding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part theexisting fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political andtribal leaders. owever, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it isdifficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign suchagreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administrationbefore full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has foundevidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives ofthe Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of thecountry, where their oil fields are located. e added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENImanagement in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is along time senior official of ENI.5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at leastuntil they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address hisproblems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.6. (Source Comment: Aording to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bringorder to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leadingopposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTCmembers will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are providedby members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the noconfidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituentassembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.) of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM. AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

As of the morning of  6, an individual with aess to the information stated in confidence that Libyan NationalTransitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly electedgovernment; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan peoplefollowing the  7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister AbclelRahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: afunctioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming ofmilitia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such ashealthcare.3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Westernsecurity officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will notsign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.4.(Source Comment: Aording to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situationshould not be surprising. e regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioninginstitutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured adysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now reIalizes that due topronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to makeprogress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha arerepresentative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living intemporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in theFrench and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has seriousconcerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will beincluded in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At thesame time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any votingthere. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed tovote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the  7 election willeventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work tomaintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government canrebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest ofthe country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop. of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader AliTarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has beenunable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the  1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on  5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centrefor election materials.7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has notbeen proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm setup a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in theGNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence todisrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,and Fezzan in the South 18.) of State  : 05/13/2015. - PRODUCED TO OUSE SELECT BENGAZI COMM.

We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to alltheir families and colleagues.A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack onour office in Benghazi.I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. e spoke eloquently about hispassion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than twodecades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as aPeace Corps Volunteer in Moroo. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the groundin Benghazi. e risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, freenation. e spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America'svalues and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department tenyears ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americanswe lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took theirlives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.

Central Daylight TimeSubj: Left at the Gate - blog,  14, 2009Odds On the Big A Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader saysthat he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local communityaround the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week that SLGreen/ard Rock made a presentation on .""ard Rock is the right balance,"" [Pres/CEO Marc] olliday said. ""Its recognized brand and quality entertainmentwill attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a ard Rock, Iwant to see it.""One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (""shovel-ready, in theground, the day after the award."")And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's which, more importantly than comprising yetanother virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, thefinancial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither aparticular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's pieceone step further by coming up with a morning line.<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bidof $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the realestate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition ofgaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante v. Floyd Flakedoesn't hurt either.SL Green/ard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the ard Rock brand name as mentionedabove. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they werepassed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effortand a major community initiative  after appearingindifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million tofollow). The addition of arrah's adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reachedaommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. owever, a part of me wants tolist them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped outafter failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by AttorneyGeneral Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if herinvolvement here is going to help or hurt.Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a badgrade from the hotel unions  asreported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.e'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles each bidder has been featured in. But, quitesimply, he sometimes comes off as a nut .Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gamingoperator with a solid balance sheet which would probably do ascompetent a job as anyone else.R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; goodluck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though thingshave been looking up of late  ). Would be a majorsurprise.Andrew FrankManaging Partner New YorkKreab Gavin Anderson515 Madison Avenue, 18th floor, New York, NY 10022, United StatesTelMobFax +1 212 935 6577www.kreabgavinanderson.com <http://www.kreabgavinanderson.comhThis communication is only intended for the use of the individual or entity, to which it is directed and maycontain information that is privileged, confidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

I've followed this caserture on homefront cries out for justiceComments  26, 2009BY CAROL MARIN  Sun-Times ColumnistThe feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteninglycloser.And the irony screams out.Carol MannOn , the same day Eric older, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a specialcounsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appealscourt at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country wherehe was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, beforeit re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as ""terrorist"" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of omeland Security and to the Justice Department'sImmigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of arbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace.In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a agan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and p. FredUpton, a conservative publican, Parlak would still be in jail.Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day olderlaunched his torture inquiry.B5The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons andJudge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose hisrelationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is theattorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroftand Alberto Gonzales.The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court ofAppeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By  of 2005, Posner noted ""a staggering 40 percent of the136 petitions"" had been reversed due to, aording to one ruling, a willingness to ignore ""the most basic of facts.""Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes withboth clarity and conviction, arguing the government's ""awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of ourcountry.""Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his owncolleagues, and ends by saying, ""I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by thewayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.""Parlak's legal team will appeal.Meanwhile, older, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping older examines the ongoing domestic legal torture ofIbrahim Parlak."

But you probably need more strategy time, less events as the ultimate judgment will be on •whether iran, nk get the bomb, progress in Mideast, suess in Afghanistan, Iraq. Obama's pause on Afghanistan goeswell with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it ismaking the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries — anydecision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan, rest is secondary at this point.That's my view for what it's worth. Take care."

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe thespecific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us./Let me know what you each think. Thx.Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—thehistoric bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinionis unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of theBush era.Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and hisausation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to amelioratehis remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. is clumsy outburst wasa classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true.The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion,has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearingswill go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as anenthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for theAfghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held.Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UKdiplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. e is not only being interviewed on allBritish media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers andjournals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the mostresolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administrationis considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eagerto be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with thecontempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservativegovernment in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer'sdaughter, Margaret Thatcher.And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the ries, about five points down,the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the ries.The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistanprocess, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. Seethe lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting inCopenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention toBrown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishmentshould be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article. The Times 26, 2009Atlantic driftWashington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time andattention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on  that ""the whole world"" had a responsibilityto help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. e would, he said; soon lay out the ""obligations of our international partners"".Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On  the President had his tenth meeting with hisadvisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. e has now spent almost three months considering his options, andhas promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to theNato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue aseparate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.Until the White ouse decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the numberrequested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the ObamaAdministration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does notseem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestionthat it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, theanger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannotbe answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Natocampaign.On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked thesegrowling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeplyunpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close aspossible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there isalready worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of thepersistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of themain pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympatheticallyunderstood on both sides when fighting a war.The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White ouse no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions andpolitical options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point ininvesting time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allieshave interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during hiselection campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he hascertainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlanticrelationship.On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. e talks of sending 500 extra troops. Butuntil he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and wasstretched to breaking point by ny Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. day America isenjoying Thanksgiving. morrow it must look out again to its allTE SPECTATORA special form of disrespectCon Coughlin , 18th  2009"

I haven't read it yet so not surewhat's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting thatthis speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more heretoo. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremonyhonoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I wasasked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention mightliterally save her life.Look forward to further discussion later today."

Part of a broader Internet outreach by PresidentBarack Obama's administration, Clinton's Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors.Since taking over at Foggy Bottom, Clinton's team has built on e-diplomacy innovations developed during George W.Bush's presidency:- They have revamped the department's Web site (http://www.state.gov) and the Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.govand http://twitter.com/dipnote) with a fresh array of features, graphics and colorful posts.- Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5)- They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube(http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo).- They can pose questions through an ""ask-the-secretary"" column(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) that recently was revised to ""text the secretary.""(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm)""New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy, where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential toachieving our foreign policy goals,"" said Cheryl Mills, Clinton's longtime confidante and chief of staff.Even for a government Web site, early indications show a surge in interest, aording to internal State Departmentstatistics provided to The Associated Press.Daily views of the Dipnote have doubled from 10,000 a year ago to 20,000 today, with 700 subscribers to its RSS feed,twice as many as in  2008. The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan. 20, whenObama took office, while the department's Facebook friends have increased by 2 1/2 times in the same period.8""What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment,"" said Peter Daou, who was Clinton's Web guru during her2008 presidential run. ""They are starting to push the envelope.""What remains unclear, though, is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public's fascinationwith Clinton's latest career shift.""The personality behind it can't be dismissed,"" said Daou, who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U.N.Dispatch (http://www.undispatch.com).Like Obama, Clinton carries a Blackberry, but she is not allowed to use it on the department's secure seventh floorwhere her office is. Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web, responding to bloggers andpushing her agency's new media agenda.""The United States Government is behind nearly everybody, except in certain discrete areas, in terms of technology,""she told department employees at a town hall meeting in . ""We are, in my view, wasting time, wasting money,wasting opportunities, because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the businessworld and the private world.""Clinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign. She announced her entry into therace in  2007 on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals.Nonetheless, Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaign's mastery of the Internet and social networking sites.Obama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers.Clinton was first lady when the first White ouse Web site debuted in 1994. It was a bare-bones operation comparedwith what is available now. Three years later, the State Department went online during Secretary of State MadeleineAlbright's tenure.But it wasn't until 2007, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's spokesman, Sean McCormack, that thedepartment's public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest. McCormack started the Dipnote blog, whichsome foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy.The site endured under Rice. Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts fromdiplomats.It's more than just window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter to ""tweet"" down false rumors they fearedmight lead to a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Madagascar.On her first two foreign trips, to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe, local bloggers were ""embedded"" with thetraveling press corps, broadening the audience for Clinton's official meetings and public appearances, which oftenproduce more personal than policy questions.On her question site, Clinton has responded to a varied questions, from ""Should the U.S. engage in direct dialogue withamas?"" to ""ow did you like meeting the Japanese students?""By the end of Clinton's trip to the Mideast, her ""text the secretary"" feature had received nearly 2,000 text messages. Onboth trips, Clinton also participated in Webcasts. One in Beijing on climate change generated more than 10.2 millionpage views, more than 50,000 comments and 7,000 questions, aording to the statistics.Clinton's staff say they plan to venture further into the realm of social networking, an animated online world calledSecond Life, and cell phone technology. The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized9project that brought together Facebook, Google, owcast, YouTube, AT&T, MTV, Columbia Law School, Aess360Mediaand Gen-Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit.It also wants to expand on X-Life, a mobile phone game launched in  that is aimed at helping youth in theMiddle East learn English and teaching them about American history, culture and values.Copyright © 2009 The Associated Press.

For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collectivecommitment and resolve.Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Whycountries in the Western emisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to aiti in the midst of aglobal economic downturn that has shaken us all.We're gathered at this conference because what happens in aiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond theAmericas. The suess or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9million citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economicrecovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.The United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties toaiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles forindependence; through the defeat of slavery in aiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on withtheir fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of aitians who emigrated to the UnitedStates and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits ofwhich I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their presentlevel of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,freedom and opportunity.With aiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people whoare seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning toreap dividends in economic growth, wider aess to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety andsecurity-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve.day, aiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have-nots. But in 2006, aiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point forthe IMF's eavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on theway, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that aiti can invest directly in improving the lives ofits people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.aiti has the region's highest rate of IV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of childmortality. But the numbers of IV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.Not long ago, aiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006jump-started aiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strongcommitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on  with elections for the Senate.Like many nations, including the United States, aiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drugtrafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, anda peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many aitian communities.aiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented heretoday. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through linksamong businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources andrelationships, which is the heart of smart power.That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.aiti is in danger of stalling.This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with aiti at the helm-toadvance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for aiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help aiti needs to get back on track. With thesepriorities as our guide and aiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundationfor stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for aiti and our region as awhole.Now is the time to step up our investment in aiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences ofinaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one aitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost ofsolving these problems if they escalate over time.The United States will target our support toward three areas that the aitian government has requested, which areaimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.First, the aitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in thecivic lives of their communities without fear of violence.Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robusteconomy. Meanwhile, the people of aiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can aomplish two thingsat once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout aiti.And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.Now aiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projectsin the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance andseeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in aiti. CiteSoleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt inthe streets.The aitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in aiti, which is thefirst in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission withdetermination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.But criminal networks operating in aiti have not been eliminated. aiti continues to fight drug traffickers who havemade this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. Thatincludes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in aiti through the Merida Initiative, a planconceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications networkfor the aitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide trainingto promote cross-border cooperation between aiti and the Dominican public; and sharpen the investigation andprosecution of drug crimes.Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generousassistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyondpeacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.aiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one ofthe region's highest population growth rates. gether, these trends have created what one development expert hascalled a ""youth tsunami""-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years. spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the OPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in aiti tariff-freeaess to the U.S. market. Last , we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of thelargest sectors in aiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil'sinterest in supporting the aitian apparel industry as well.But to build a diversified economy, aiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support theflow of goods and services. The roads in aiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of apassable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing theircrops to market.Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more aitians into the global economy.aiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needsinclude digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canalsto help irrigation.As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to aiti this year, we have authorized $20million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward toworking with aiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economicgrowth.All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed awaymonths of government planning for the future. aiti is facing anapproximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine aiti's long-term ambitions as well as services thatpeople depend on to survive.The United States will provide $20 million to pay aiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free aiti to use itsresources to fill that budget gap.[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping aiti resolve. The combined effect ofrising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of aitians tomalnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a directthreat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of foodto help aiti as it continues to rebuild. ]These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with aiti and other nations. But there areadditional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping aiti adapt to climate change so futurehurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; anddeveloping civil society.This work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. ere in the U.S., I have heard frommany individuals and groups who care about aiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their timeand money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside governmentget involved in a meaningful way with aiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential tohelp in places like aiti has not yet been tapped.We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my ownvisits to aiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met adoctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town ofPignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. e and his staff had few resources, but theyoffered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.I visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect theirhealth and prevent teen pregnancy.And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference onwomen's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to supportaitian women running for office.Eleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supportingwomen candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach womentheir rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.These aitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And theydemonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the aitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery.Our role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future isas important as our own.What happens next in aiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poornation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.On behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip ofArgentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whosefutures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recoverythat reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere."

Carleto demands.""Yes, I """"Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?""""SNCC,"" Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary ofthe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the BlackPanthers.B6""e's a good guy,"" Carleto continues. ""You tell him that.""Forman smiles. ""e passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,"" the professor says. e scansthe room. The Oak ill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-bluepolo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairsback as far as possible against the wall.Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.They lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. ""I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,""Forman continues. ""And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenilejustice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. SoI thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.""Carleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.""And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things youknow. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.""Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.Dead silence.e smiles encouragingly. ""My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, thatnow runs your school,"" he says.Carleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends hisshort dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.A few Georgetown students jump.e looks out over the top of his glasses. ""My name's Carleto Bailey,"" he says. ""My interesting fact is that I'mfunny./Ie gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak ill student Ashawnteaenderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: ""And I'm smart.""But as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak ill Academy -- aren't going toaept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on amultiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.Afterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. ""Inmates?sidents? Scholars?"" one of them asks. ""Does it matter what you're called?""Carleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. e struggles. ""Not somuch,"" he says, finally. e looks at her. She seems unconvinced. e worries that he has given the wronganswer and tries again.""Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're upto.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're alreadylabeled.""""What are the labels?"" Forman asks.This one is easy for Carleto. e sinks down in his chair and throws it out.""Trouble,"" he says.***Carleto Bailey is trouble. e is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak ill Academy with afew disadvantages: e has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has hadmultiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth habilitation Services, which runs Oak ill,won't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we doknow this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. is academic knowledge is spotty at best. e can tellyou who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. (""Dear, Fidel"" he writes in amock letter to Castro during English class.) e is a fairly typical Oak ill ""scholar.""And, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak ill Academy aredetermined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes intheir education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth habilitation Services, theschool opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.What would happen, Oak ill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seducedthese kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caringteachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,what would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campusof a decidedly different nature?""The bottom line,"" says Domenici, ""is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, butthey've gotten the worst.""It is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three publiccharter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the aAngelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6p.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offeredsupervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of a Angelou graduates wereaepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (Aording to the District's Office of the StateSuperintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and citycharter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)It is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about40 percent of a Angelou students had spent some time at Oak ill -- working inside the gates posed a newset of challenges. Youth habilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to ahistory of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reformefforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak ill, he saw immediatelythat changing the school was essential. ""ow could I look at my staff at Oak ill and say we are aboutexcellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?""Schiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. ""It wasa miserable, miserable school.""Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate theschool, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted aplan that Schiraldi says ""blew the other ones out of the water,"" and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contractto run the school for the next three years.Domenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexicopublican senator Pete Domenici. e went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few yearsand then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, whowas the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduatedfrom Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom hemet through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became partof the first a Angelou public charter school.At Oak ill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an oasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:functioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted bycorrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take theirmeds. Forman is chairman of the a Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board memberof its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. e attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising andadvocating for juvenile justice reform.""When David came out to run the school here, it was like ""Ocean's 12"": Go find all the people you can trustfrom your previous mission,"" Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few a Angelougraduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak ill herself when she was 15 on anaessory assault charge, went to a a Angelou school and now runs the Oak ill Academy welcome center.""I tell them, I was here, too,"" Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old anddidn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. ""I say: 'You're at an intersection in yourlife. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice aboutwhat's up the road ahead.'""Many of the 90 Oak ill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, andnearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak ill for an average of 10 months,cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, theyare grouped aording to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can bein classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak ill for violent felonies. Fights arecommon. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his releasedate.)Through the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and aguard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity andget them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. Forexample, during the lationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those betweenhumans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohsand their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,students will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: ""Why do relationshipsmatter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?"" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.public school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headingssuch as ""Changes in the Way umans Think About the World and Their Place in It,"" which becomes a way ofintroducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizeslearning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typicallyeschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.Oak ill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-teaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy ""isessential to teaching them to be good citizens.""""We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of acommunity,"" Domenici says. ""We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that ourdemocracy demands.""But this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak ill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to thinkcritically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? ow do you teach empowerment in asetting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?Although he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learnthat one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or ""graduated"" from the program only tocommit another crime and be sent back. ""I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do theabsolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,"" he says, reminding them that they don'tcontrol all the pieces of the puzzle. ""And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.""is staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,knowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of suess. And, absent the rightsupport, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: ""I think Carleto has a good chance of finishinghigh school and going on to college,"" Domenici says. Pause. ""Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.""***It is a cold day in late , and Oak ill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed injeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak ill social studies teacher JohnAdams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at hisdesk.""Pay attention,"" he says, taking Carleto's pencil. ""Carleto, what is today's essential question?""""What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?"" Carleto says, reading from theboard where Adams has scrawled his topic.""Yes,"" Adams says. e ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the studentsnatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is howcorrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back ofthe room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.""Please sit,"" Adams tells the student.Not quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.Good enough.Adams continues: ""What's the difference between personal change and historical change?""Silence.""Anybody?More silence.""Ashawntea?""""istorical change is like a revolution,"" Ashawntea says.Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of PresidentObama -- and Carleto aurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.""Obama's campaign was all about change,"" Adams says. ""Do you think he is talking historical change?"" ewants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first100 days look like? he asks the students. ""What advice would you offer him?""Carleto looks stumped.""Just throw out some ideas,"" Adams prompts. e tells the students that they are going to craft their own lettersto the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. ""Obama's not reading our letters,"" he says. e folds his arms acrosshis chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers reallywant to hear his ideas.***Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's""Dreams  My Father."" ""It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,"" he says. e struggles hard toarticulate the book's themes and appeal. ""I don't know how to put it,"" he says finally, ""but growing up with -- nodisrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.""Sitting in a guard's room off the gym on a  evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncingbasketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.""As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he wason the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,"" he says, beginning in third person, but quicklylapsing into first. ""In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doingstuff I wasn't supposed to be doing.""e takes full responsibility. ""No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I washigh,"" he explains. e, like almost all the teens at Oak ill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto saysthat his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in ""a neighborhood thing."" ""Nowadays,anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,"" he says, explaining thathis buddy was shot because of a ""miscommunication."" ""It wasn't intended for us,"" he says, insisting that he andhis friend, nicknamed ""Smoke,"" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, ""I don't want to talk aboutit.""So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: e will doodle ""R.I.P. Smoke"" on the cover of his blue folder or ona piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.e's happy to talk about Oak ill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak ill and tests fairly high on assessments.)Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. e complains thatthe classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class isgetting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. e says that he will be leaving Oak ill intwo months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak ill's transition center in the District, from which he sayshe will graduate this . When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to ""the Adidas shop in Georgetown,where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.""e says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak ill. ""She was. . . I'm going to say shewas kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,"" Carleto says. ""You know how they say 'Whatever hidesin the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me."" Meanwhile, she makes thelong, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. ""Every weekend, both days!"" he says.e is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. e has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. e says his mom works as asecretary, but he struggles to remember where. ""She was working with, what's that program downtown by theWashington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the olocaustMuseum. It's a brick building. She works there.""Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different aount of Carleto's life.Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in  as he says. e is still six credits shy, Jones says.And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.Carleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming toOak ill. is mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrestedrepeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well asprostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years forassault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.She is not visiting Carleto on weekends.***By the end of , still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak ill teens file into their advocacy class,jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. luctantly theytake their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prisonyard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Oasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.day, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of colorare 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this isdisproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has onthe desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, ""Racism of the Juvenile Justice Systemvealed,"" to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: ""African-Americanyouths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained foridentical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formallycharged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similarbreak.""Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak ill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth habilitation Services care in settings across the city,disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Feetries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. ""ey,"" he says, suddenly sitting forward.""They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even thoughthere's more of them.""""Yes,"" Fee says. ""So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.""Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasonsbehind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this fromdifferent perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. ""So, we're going to havethree roles,"" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. ""One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a mathteacher; and one group is playing a city council member.""Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation onreforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. e doesn't even want to behere today. e wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. e puts his glasses on, then takesthem off.""ow could you maintain better relationships"" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carletoand his partner work through this.Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullenchallenge. ""Stop harassing people for no reason?""""ow do you want them to treat people?""""Equally,"" he says. e picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be morespecific.""Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,"" Carleto'spartner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.""And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?"" Fee prods.A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher beforeenrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.""Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,"" Carleto says.""Patrol each ward equally?"" asks Fee.Carleto writes that down, then adds: ""I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right."" Fee nods, encourageshim to write it down.Carleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. ""The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I couldsay, 'The majority of police are racist.'""""But how would you fix that?"" Fee. prods.""A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one,"" Carleto suggests. e sits upstraighter in his chair. ""And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's thereason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever."" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, andhe rattles off a list of improvements.""Call to order of the city council,"" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. ""ello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,""Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. ""We have somecomplaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions aboutcracking down on officers."" e sounds nervous as he begins the list. ""Stop harassing minorities and other ethnicyouths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at theschool like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents whythis happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police."" e moves briskly through thesuggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,""verbally abusing"" youth won't be tolerated any more. ""Basically, we want to crack down on the officers andhave them removed, if so.""Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard'swalkie-talkie. ""Time to go!"" the guard announces.The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.""Wait!"" Ashawntea says, standing up. ""We got 10 more minutes.""""It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,"" the guard says.""But we have 10 minutes!"" Carleto insists. e and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. ""It's only 2:20.We got 10 more minutes still.""The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. e goes back out into the hall to wait.Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. is advocacy worked.""Yesss!"" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.Karen ouppert is a contributing writer for the Magazine. She can be reached at me@karenhouppert corn."

1547,1548,109,101,9.0,339,1,1,1," 25, 2009Clinton, in Iraq, Blames 'jectionists' for Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGDAD — Secretary of State illary RodhamClinton arrived here  morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles asudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded severalhundred more on  and .Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She saidshe would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her firstmeeting on , a day packed with appointments.But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsedIraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail theprogress the country has made in the last two years.""In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,"" Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannouncedvisit  evening. ""But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.""She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of ""rejectionists"" who fear that the government willsueed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are ""in an unfortunately tragic way, asignal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.""""Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,"" Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, ""If you look at the evidence,overwhelmingly the progress that's been made has been positive.""The Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve ""stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance,"" asthe United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011.Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted toauthorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, thoughthe attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist andjihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit thewithdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that ourred several months afterthe Good  peace aord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its""last throes,"" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of ""dead-enders"" who kept fighting a lost cause.On , Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a ouse appropriationscommittee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, hesaid, were from Tunisia.Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: ""We've seen suicide bombers frommany countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and oasionally even a young woman,would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.""41The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she wasscheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-Maliki; and the foreign minister, oshyar Zebari.She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is tohold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincialreconstruction teams.This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from SouthKorea to Turkey. ""I want to listen,"" she said, ""I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedbackand ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as suessful as possible.""When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter fromBaghdad International Airport into the city. e met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno atthe American base, Camp Victory.The new American ambassador, Christopher R. ill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. e was confirmed by theSenate on  after a lengthy process that was held up by publican senators, who objected to his lack ofexperience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.In Iraq, Mr. ill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraqexperts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in  of the lastUnited States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker."
1548,1549,109,101,9.0,339,1,1,1,"Clinton says Iraq on right trackBAGDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State illary Rodham Clinton says this week's deadly suicide bombings in Iraq are asign that extremists fear the Iraqi government is sueeding.On her first visit to Iraq as America's top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite therecent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. militarypresence there.Clinton arrived in Baghdad  on an unannounced trip after suicide bombings in the capital and outside killedat least 148 people on  and .

The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic andpublican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the FinanceCommittee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs forthose who already have coverage.President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, whichmeans he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.The mandate was a central policy difference with illary Clinton, who argued that a mandatewas the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people wouldpurchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 millionpeople. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularlyassailed Obama for his no-mandate position.Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care."

(New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffectionwith all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as thenext day,  5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles andmotives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be ForeignSecretary, a job held by his grandfather, erbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, whydoesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour atthis point. e supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the toptax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudgingunderstanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning theproject for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is acontemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. nybitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked toDamian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his bloggingscheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's andbecome Business Secretary. David would be pushed into ome Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter'sjob, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party'sleft-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. nysees the situation as terminal. ope to speak with him soon. e is trying to become President ofEurope if and when Lisbon treaty passes.

This marks a shift from his stance duringthe campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, andhe did not.""I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs,and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,"" Obama wrote. ""But I believe if we are going to makepeople responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.""""If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide ahardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,"" Obama wrote.Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also saidAmericans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health caresystem.""I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operatingalongside private plans,"" he wrote. ""This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care marketmore competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.""e offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government.Employers ""have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,"" Obama wrote, but smallbusinesses should be exempt.Obama's positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in beforecongressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aideshad declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individualmandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill.But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides theguidance that many in Congress had been craving as ouse and Senate committees move closer to releasingdraft bills.""The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski(D-Md.), a member of the Senate ealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ""The letter essentiallysynthesizes what the president is saying.""e outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and ealth,Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).Obama's endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalystfor the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign .""It's clear that the publican resistance to a public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support for one,""Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. ""This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for apublic option, which is the only way to keep the private insurers' feet to the fire.""Despite almost uniform opposition from publicans on the public plan, the president wrote in the letter that heremains ""hopeful that many publicans"" would back an overhaul bill.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking publican on the Finance Committee, struck an optimistic tone ina statement, saying the letter ""doesn't draw lines in the sand,"" and ""is helpful because of his statements thatreform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.""owever, the letter is likely to incite opponents, who have been frustrated by Obama's lack of specifics.Indeed, on  morning, Conservatives for Patients' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called""Bulldozer,"" which says a ""government-run plan"" will drive private insurers out of business and eliminateconsumer choices.Back to topad more: ""Barack Obama may support insurance mandate - Carrie Budoff Brown - POLITICO.com"" -http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html#ixzz0Qhr4KMx&A"

Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against theouse version in  to change their votes, but many said they would not do so.publicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth offunding related to the International Monetary Fund. ouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said  itwould.""I believe there are people in the publican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don't want tosupport it on this bill,"" Pelosi said , ""So we have to do that with all Democratic votes.""She also pushed back against two key pillars of the ouse publican leadership's argument against the IMFfunding, which is meant to aommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization.sponding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to thewar spending measure, Pelosi said the IMF help was a ""national security initiative"" because it helps to alleviatesources of instability, such as poverty.Pelosi also aused ouse Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., of fear mongering by putting out a statementwarning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism.""I don't know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists,"" she said. ""It simply isnot based in fact and is a scare tactic, and most unfortunate.""ouse Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week.""We're going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days,"" said Senate Majorityleader arry id, D-Nev.6Whipping Votesouse leaders had planned to hold the conference session  and had said the ouse floor vote could beas early as . But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway afternoon. •Although several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes, including ps. Barney Frank,D-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., many others have said they would not.""It's a conscience vote,"" said p. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., who said he was inclined to not change his stance onthe bill""I haven't cracked yet,"" said p. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who along with other anti-war Democrats haspledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia.Still, many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely.More Details EmergeMeanwhile, more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out .Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, D-awaii, said that the final bill will ""in alllikelihood"" include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes, none of which was requestedby the administration or in the Senate's bill. The ouse bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s.Overall, the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the ouse version but stillbillions above the Senate version and the administration request, ouse Appropriations Defense subcommitteechairman John P. Murtha, D-Pa., said.As for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the conference report likely will include languagebarring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year, saidouse Appropriator James P. Moran, D-Va.No money towards the president's effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report, Moran added.

But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problemmerely that people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.ere's the relevant paragraph:I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- makingevery American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employersshare in the cost. I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthyand drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility. But I believeif we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make healthcare affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their owninsurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. Inaddition, while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for theiremployees, small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits andshould be exempted.B6B6By Ben Smith 07:51 PM"

Andhe has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.A COMPREENSIVE APPROAC: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLEDr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—onethat connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers laborto feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes wherepeople get the nourishment they need to thrive.In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and willgo to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work andstudents to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that whenfood is scarce, political stability is threatened.44 date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, itis a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support thecreation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agriculturalproductivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individualstrategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture DevelopmentPlan.  facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.TE ANCORS OF OUR APPROACWe've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding aess to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit topurchase them, and the training to use them.• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improvingtransportation to connect small farmers to markets.• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the rightadaptations for the changing environment.• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculturescientists.• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear andpredictable policy and regulatory environment.• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, butmost of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change foragriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.A PREVIEW OF WAT'S TO COMEIn the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach toglobal coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those whohave been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to theprivate sector. The President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address ourapproach, as well as my trip to Africa in .Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expandingopportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

These will guide ourapproach.• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding aess to quality seeds, fertilizer,irrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them.• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food andimproving transportation to connect small farmers to markets.• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we canmake the right adaptations for the changing environment.• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation ofagriculture scientists.• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far andwide.• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes ina clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment.• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers arewomen, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men.This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition tocontribute to their communities' future.A PREVIEW OF WAT'S TO COMEIn the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share ourapproach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail.

And he has trained and inspired the next generation of Africanagricultural scientists.A COMPREENSIVE APPROAC: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLEDr. Ej eta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed toaddress it—one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fieldswhere small-scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living.., the markets wherefood is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive.In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry thismorning and will go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making itharder for people to work and students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development.Last year's food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political stability is threatened. date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. Whilethis saves lives, it is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. Wewill support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around theworld, to increase agricultural productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protectnatural resources.We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carryingout individual strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive AfricaAgriculture Development Plan.  facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seekto convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations,universities, and individuals.TE ANCORS OF OUR APPROACWe've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems.

The chair asked for rebels to come forward and speak. Onlyone prominent person emerged, Charles Clarke, former ome Secretary and Blairite; the rest were ahandful of about a half-dozen backbenchers. Their remarks about how Brown was bringing the partydown were poorly received. The party, after all, was in no mood for breaking ranks and rewardingdisloyalty. With this paltry showing, the opposition petered out, at least for now. Gordon then gave aspeech, strong on analysis, discussing that his government was paying the price for getting thecountry through a difficult recession, suffering from the worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd Georgeand still had a program to offer. e also make the point that when the party had split int he past it wasover ideology or policy and there were no stated differences presented by the opposition.

1876,1877,298,0,0.0,163,1,1,1,"Just wanted to be sure you saw the Kurtzer op-ed, which ran  in the Post. Kudos to Jonathan Prince forgetting this written and placed.The Settlements Facts •By Daniel Kurtzer,  14, 2009Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's  5 column,""The Settlements Myth,"" is one example.ere are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government aepted, with some reservations, the ""road map"" for peace,which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: ""GO! [Government of Israel] immediatelydismantles settlement outposts erected since  2001. Consistent with the Mitchell port, GOI freezes allsettlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).""day, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between PrimeMinister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen adley; President George W. Bush's 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an  14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national securityadviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States aepted continuingIsraeli building within the ""construction line"" of settlements. The problem is that there was no suchunderstanding.The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion thatconstruction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow buildingonly inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around thebuilt-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in aordance with its own reading ofthese provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in whichIsrael would retain ""existing major Israeli population centers"" in the West Bank ""on the basis of mutuallyagreed changes. . . ."" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining somesettlements was predicated on there being an ""agreed outcome"" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention thatthis letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and GushEtzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these orother areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the ""construction line,"" saying that ""within theagreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definitionof the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria."" owever, there never were any ""agreed principlesof settlement activities."" Moreover, the effort to define the ""construction line"" was never consummated: Israeland the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line ofsettlements. Weissglas's letter also promised ""continuous action"" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, butIsrael removed almost none of them.Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bushadministration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regardingcontinued settlement activity.Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the ""naturalgrowth"" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this ""means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies."" This is nonsense. No onesuggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right tobuild more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, likeAmericans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,when Israel signed the Oslo Aords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the naturalincrease of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of ""natural growth"" in officialdocuments started with the 2001 Mitchell port and the 2003 ""road map,"" reflecting recognition that theconcept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuingpolicies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility ofachieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no"" way justify Israeli failure toimplement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freezeall settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.The writer, US. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies atPrinceton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs."

1901,1902,157,0,7.0,349,1,1,1,"FYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources andis very well informed. 17, 2009Is this another Iranian revolution? someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developmentsin Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, oftenmarching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faceddetermined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants andritual calls of ""Down with the shah!""; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.You need only change ""shah"" to ""dictator,"" and you have a description of what is happening in Irantoday.But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named AyatollahKhomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause herepresented. On the other side was Mohammed za Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On thesurface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns waveredand the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.day the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir ossein Mousavi, who isnotably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, AyatollahIChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for hisreligious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political systemand the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerfulsecurity forces, including the volutionary Guards.Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. Thefraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedenteddemonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers bythe regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that peoplestay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter offormer president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then ""ordered"" everyone tomarch the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).IChamene'i announced the ""divine assessment"" of the election outcome — even before it would probablyhave been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that wasresponsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no oneexpected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace andreconciliation. No one paid any attention.I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his ""victory,"" he went offto a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. e seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passiveplayer than a major actor in these events.So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that isprobably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.On the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being madeby the ultra-conservative leadership of the volutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned overthe past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterlyruthless and ideologically fueled.New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on  15 below)at the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it's often prudentto bet on Might, at least in the short run.The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — theannouncement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence theopposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were beingmade by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such asIChamene'i who are austomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have amuch larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slimmargin (which was at least believable).All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to haveconcluded that their social contract with the rulers — aepting Islamic rule in return for a respectfulregard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic public — is no longer valid. They do not trust theirrulers.The rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of thecountry, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have calledthat tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear tobe a moment to bet on Might.But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and coulddetermine the future path of the Iranian revolution.There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmencrackdown ourred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of China at the time was ZhaoZiyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party. e was later fired and placed under house arrest.is smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dershipabout how to proceed.Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one canonly presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic public of Iran?Dell Days of Deals!  15-24 - A New Deal Everyday!"
1902,1903,1055,0,7.0,349,1,1,1,",  18, 2009Day of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Mir-osain Mousavi, who maintains he won last 's presidential election despite official assertions that helost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally , this time in part to honor thepersons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations.Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicismin Europe, and Mousavi's camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiitemartyr is Imam usayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraqand was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. dognition that a Muslim state might commit theultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet's knee has imbued modernpolitical Shiism with a distrust of the state. When usayn's head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid anddeposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, ""I saw theProphet's lips on those cheeks."" Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam ordivinely-appointed leader.day's protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi's descent from the Prophet Muhammad.(Mousavi's family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divineknowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descentfrom the Prophet, often take one of the Imams' names as a family name to honor them, though of course theyare also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest thereformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic volution-- they are chanting ""God is Great,"" mourningpious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites.But now Mousavi's his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for thefallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 suchdemonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached analleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming 's rally was a million,you wonder where things will go from here.The regime's attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wisePresident Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hardliners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. Ifthe reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. Ifthe hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat's paws of a grasping,imperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign oupation so as to get powerthemselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, havingsuffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century.The prescriptions of John McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deafto Iranian realities and would backfire big time, harming both the reform cause and US interests. Anyway, afterthe basket case to which the US publican Party reduced Iraq, no one in the global South is likely to wantthem meddling in their internal affairs.ports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia menfollowing protesters home and breaking into their homes to terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forcesterrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during theopposition demonstrations, but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them.Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met  morning with the representatives of all four presidentialcandidates, urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by 24 million to14 million votes. e portrayed the massive post-election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minortiff.Gary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more, and hints that the hard line tack ofstealing the election was directed by the Iranian volutionary Guard Corps, the country's religious nationalguard.ports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes,using helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij, the right wing militia (sort of likeMussolini's Black Shirts) to do the breaking and entering. Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspectedsatellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested.Dell Days of Deals!  15-24 - A New Deal Everyday!"

Beck says you were friends in law school & thought yourecognized him when he came in w/Pres. ribiong. ope you're not in pain and mendsoon. Jeff 20, 2009The Myth of the $12 Million Uighur. By STUART BECKCONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if onlybriefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson ribiong, to dothe United States a favor: Please aept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-Americanterrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless,harmless.President ribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told PresidentObama and Secretary of State illary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless,and could be integrated into Palau's small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence broughtsatisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched anumber of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records.One would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded,at least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors havetwisted Palau's act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story thatPalau was amenable to President Obama's request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Departmentofficials had linked Palau's aeptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.Almost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12million dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown.Before the story gets too far out of hand, let's consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have aneconomic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over thepast 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has alwaysinsisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the UnitedStates or Palau require it.B6In 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. Thatagreement's economic terms expire in  2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in theworks — and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted atlinking the deal to Palau's aeptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for theUighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can getoriented and get jobs.Palau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown.Social life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders ofPalau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knitpeople would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.Last week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined theUnited States Marines and died on  1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. e was the fourth Palauanserviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl.Meresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our country's specialrelationship with the United States. Can't Americans be proud of the relationship, too?Stuart Beck is Palau's permanent representative to the United Nations."

Lots ofpeople have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--soif they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many peopleare thinking about you now.I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostagecrisis, and is now at Columbia. e has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding eventsGary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-manneredreformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly notthe Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arenaas a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclosebelow Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does helet it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't aomplish anything withthe regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. e points out that thefirst mass demonstrations against the Shah ourred a full year before his overthrow. e adds thatthe one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidatecontrol, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, forexample, was good. e also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging theregime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkagein negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Polandand Czech public (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.Get well. See Sick analysis below.Sid5ousavi's New volutionary Manifestoby Gary Sick 21, 2009 I 10:51am—L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick,•the key White ouse offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform fora true Islamic democracy.Plus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers.day, Mir ossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirationsof the Iranian people, issued a formal statement.Although he denounces the ""lies and fraud"" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views thefraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. e describes a revolution gonewrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in ""forcingan unwanted government on the nation.""It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormouslyin the past week.This moment is ""a turning point,"" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a""historical mission"" to aomplish nothing less than ""renewing the life of the nation"" aording to its ownideals.e acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less ""eloquent"" than he would havewished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he aepts the ""burdenof duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.""e denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that ""Islamic governmentis the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;"" and on the other, those who ""consider religion and Islam to be blockersfor realization of republicanism,"" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, ""is agiven right."" The objective is nothing less than ""to achieve a new type of political life in the country.""That is truly a revolutionary statement. e says he will stand by the side of all those seeking ""new solutions"" ina n on-violent way. e aepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic public, including thevolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces ""deviations and deceptions."" e demands reform ""thatreturns us to the pure principles of the Islamic volution.""e calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to expresstheir views freely, ""there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.""It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormouslyin the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past severaldays, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he nevermentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This openopposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. •Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic public. The repression and disdain ofthe government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knowswhere any of the parties are likely to go next.But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack underyour feet.Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and agan. e was theprincipal White ouse aide for Iran during the Iranian volution and the hostage crisis and is the author oftwo books on U.S.-Iranian relations.

This challenges the notion thatAhmadinejad's victory was due to the massive participation of apreviously silent conservative majority.•In a third of all provinces, the official results would require thatAhmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all formercentrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of formerformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these twogroups.•In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, andAhmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas.That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claimthat this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provincesflies in the face of these trends.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 31. Irregularities in Voter TurnoutTwo provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout ofover 90%. gional variations in participation have disappeared. There is nocorrelation between the increase in participation, and the swing toAhm adinejad.Firstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with severalprovinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increaseresults in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with thestandard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provincesrecording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two werebelow 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces hadturnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variationsin participation have suddenly disappeared.This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provincesthat saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between theincrease in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase inparticipation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election forAhmadinejad somewhat problematic.Furthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Twoprovinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more voteswere cast on 12  than there were eligible voters and that four moreprovinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.In a country where allegations of 'tombstone voting' — the practice200f using theidentity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstandingand widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; aording to official statisticsgathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistancein Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time ofMohammed Khatami's 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.In conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures areproblematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regionalvariations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases inturnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the resultsproblematic.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 4Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 52. Where did Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come ?Aording to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix),Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial levelresults between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President,challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has comeout to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly formerMehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejadreceived not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjanivoters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previouslyvoted formist.Aording to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has receivedapproximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservativevote in the 2005 Presidential election2.Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005,these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, indescending order of likelihood:•The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but choseto vote in this election•The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005•The 10.4m citizens who voted for formist candidates in 2005In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad's increased support camefrom, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote byprovince, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, andformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that2005 voters will vote again.The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, inorder for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed towin over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% offormer reformist voters.1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad canreasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in2005. ere, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance is compared to the combinedperformance of all three Conservatives in 2005.Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 6It is notable that many of these are provinces where the formist cleric MehdiKarrubi polled highly in 2005, and the government's figures would appear tosuggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likelyformist challenger Mir ussein Musavi, as many had expected, but ratherthat they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between thepercentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing toAhmadinejad (Fig.2). many formists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is awell-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues ofpolitical and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy.They allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi's vote hascollapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeatedc andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.owever, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a 'man of the people', andAhmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic public's early hardleft as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thusclaim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the samereasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.The data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukema's applicationof statistical fraud detection techniques to the 'by district' data has turned upsome anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi's vote,3 which maysuggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed upshould the fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data be released during theongoing dispute.3 B Roukena, 'Benford's Law Anomalies in the 2009 Iranian Presidential Election' (asyet unpublished article, 2009).Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 7Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 8Potential sources of new votes for Ahmadinejad (Fig.3)ProvinceAhmadinejadVoters '09AhmadinejadVoters '05OtherConservativeVoters '05Non-Voters'05RafsanjaniVoters '05formist Voters '05Assumed Takeof FormerformistVotersEastAzerbaijan1,131,111 198,417 150,235 684,745 268,954 690,784 -24.79%WestAzerbaijan623,946 75,319 156,724 520,896 151,525 409,798 -68.45%Ardebil 325,911 34,090 114,038 161,510 95,490 232,505 -34.07%Isfahan 1,799,255 801,635 271,861 854,867 260,858 423,098 -92.17%Ilam 199,654 32,383 47,865 20,165 40,580 168,179 34.88%Bushehr 299,357 82,376 55,169 81,202 97,412 171,637 -9.79%Tehran 3,819,495 1,500,829 860,548 2,424,653 1,274,276 1,345,533 -166.54%Chaharmahal& Bakhtiari359,578 90,960 87,195 126,366 59,521 128,451 -3.48%SouthernKhorasan285,984 101,638 54,759 95,657 57,244 71,939 -32.41%RazaviKhorasan2,214,801 377,732 956,641 638,925 527,707 656,736 -43.58%NorthernKhorasan341,104 22,954 116,991 115,487 70,407 135,090 11.30%Khuzestan 1,303,129 232,874 206,798 543,802 319,921 707,428 -0.04%Zanjan 444,480 93,309 94,234 132,237 110,698 150,062 9.33%Semnan 295,177 98,024 65,249 90,128 69,773 56,344 -49.69%Sistan &Baluchistan450,269 47,743 93,559 117,432 155,147 563,454 6.46%Fars 1,758,026 242,535 334,925 738,209 403,074 786,195 5.00%Qazvin 498,061 118,414 102,048 188,868 108,928 168,013 -12.02%Qom 422,457 256,110 36,686 125,178 104,004 67,557 -147.31%Kordestan 315,689 22,353 59,174 251,014 54,004 211,918 -33.44%Kerman 1,160,446 129,284 333,275 337,502 480,271 215,357 -55.67%Kermanshah 573,568 70,117 137,472 251,113 137,010 374,100 -5.92%Kohgilouye &Boyerahmad253,962 34,396 72,565 53,615 56,154 148,985 24.99%Golestan 515,211 56,776 129,856 156,256 155,498 358,715 4.69%Gilan 998,573 149,026 221,632465,190 215,478 420,258 -12.55%Lorestan 677,829 69,710 101,394 162,848 121,130 500,859 44.47%Mazandaran 1,289,257 159,291 581,654 581,269 311,949 270,104 -127.69%Markezi 572,988 161,669 89,086 200,024 143,118 184,172 -11.35%ormozegan 482,990 81,054 103,487 136,459 75,601 340,740 25.35%amedan 765,723 195,030 96,988 218,400 175,997 322,938 24.56%Yazd 337,178175,206 76,209 150,781 77,924 123,828 -115.44%tals 24,515,209 5,711,254 5,808,317 10,624,798 6,179,653 10,404,777Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 93. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?Many commentators have suggested, before and after the PresidentialElection, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explainshis high levels of support. owever, the data from the 2005 Presidentialelection does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that whatsupport Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburbanareas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad againstthe rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as agroup (Fig.5).Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 10Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census of2006 (see appendix)This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supportersoasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact thatmuch of Iran's rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch,•Kurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history bothof voting formist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. Forexample, they were an important segment of Khatami's vote in 1997 and 2001and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely theserural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any otherconservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At thesame time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who wasextremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsedentirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled byan overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting thathe has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for4 Cf. ooglund 'Iran's Rural Vote and Election Fraud' Agence Global, 17  2009.http://www.agenceglobal.com/Article.asp?Id=2034Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Electionwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 11formist candidates in 2005.

Blumenthal refused to comment.But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves tobecome a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position wouldnot require Senate confirmation.Clinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the StateDepartment, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her formerpresidential rival's foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, apoint several Obama aides also made to Politico's Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background roleshe has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clintonfamily and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton's presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile.(Blumenthal is probably Clinton's best speechwriter, a friend notes.)In the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and firstintroduced him to future British Prime Minister ny Blair. e has also been active in the Third Way-Progressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter, Blumenthal has contributedcommentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair, Tina Brown's new online magazine The Daily Beast, the NewYorker, and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security.Laura Rozen I Permalink I fA9ç%'1 Comments? Login or register52"

1977,1978,322,0,9.0,173,1,1,1,Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) hehas clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcryfrom his fathers loyalists.
1978,1979,322,0,9.0,173,1,1,1,"Well he's very young, only 15.Rumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weightof being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can beproperly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him."

This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are ""somewhat dissatisfied"" or ""very dissatisfied"" with the waythings are going in the state, while 33 percent are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied,"" numbers that haven'tchanged since Obama was elected.In the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher andJennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOPcandidates if the election were today.""The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time votershave decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,"" said Peter A. Brown,assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.""Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President GeorgeW. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly decidingthat the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.""""Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residencyby such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share ofindependent votes,"" Brown added.""Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.These numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in and should be an indication to the White ouse that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending.""In the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner inthe race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.Former U.S. p. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer m Ganley on the publicanside, with 55 percent undecided.In general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman's 34percent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.  26 -  1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8percentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and445 publicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys inFlorida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and forresearch.

But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his roleand responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated,hardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members thatstayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast asthey can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneouslypursue.James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures anddecision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touchretired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. is°critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a Whiteouse on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy m Donilon ismanaging his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon isdeeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio,the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- aording to reports -- supported and helped cultivaterelationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the ""whack-a-mole"" crisis reaction styleof decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in nationalsecurity affairs. m Donilon, aording to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day today management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, whatthe structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. elooks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, aording to Jim Jones, thePresident's effectiveness and chances of suess at a macro level.Jones' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers forleadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growingcomplexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-makingprocess will require the attention of someone serious.So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones' management style -- but they verywell could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to havemore than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes toMiddle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration'sforeign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those ""longer knives"", onthe whole, do not have pure motives.-- Steve Clemons directs the foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation and publishes the popularpolitical blog, The Washington NoteShop Dell's full line of Laptops now starting at $349!"

2086,2087,1165,8,3.0,360,1,1,1,Let's discuss.
2087,2088,1167,0,32.0,358,1,1,1,"Dear Secretary Clinton,I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in theregion from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but themain takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technicalanalysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regionalcooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.All best, JackieKey findings from the workshop include:• Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher thanforecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000kilometers of the Chinese coastline.• The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area ofSSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.• Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral areahave continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existingrelations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of ""blue-brown water"" naval operations, in whichChinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperationeasy. These trendsinclude:Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.• Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in ainan Island,Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missilesubmarines operating close to India.• Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in ainan andeven, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, alongwith the potential for naval nuclear aidents at sea.• Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, insubmarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder forstates that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.• The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes inthis region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets inhomeland areas.The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:• The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstratethat their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and• What the United States would lose if it did not support theJapanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentiallygiving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close toterritory of a client of China, a ""blue-brown water"" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, andto force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less thanblack and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstancesunderscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of theirmilitary capabilities would suggest.On Fri,  22, 2009 at 7:45 AM, <newmyer wrote:> Secretary Clinton, The Australian is the newspaper in which I read> your remarks on Asia-Pacific.

2088,2089,335,0,49.0,358,1,1,1,"Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the nextphase of free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response totheir proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning therelationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the UnitedStates delegation to the proposals that it made in  in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specificelements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palaudelegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did notseriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau'scomprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President ribiongthe next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact.

2140,2141,36,0,32.0,117,1,1,1,"Secretary Clinton,Thank you! Will update you when I hear from her, and if there is anything else I should do, let me know. Allbest, Jackieps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeansbecause of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!): 12, 2007Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff.Thank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, hada good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time tolook around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singaporenun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria ny. I wondered why someone from Singaporewould want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and livingthat life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year,renewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure,please, there's a way out; if you are sure, then you're in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon andwhile he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, Iheard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a indu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in thiscountry, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman fromAlbania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated asan Indian, on the way to canonization.China and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deepinternal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the USand China and Europe. But if you look into it's deep construction, it is very different. When we talk aboutChina's future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, China's attitudestowards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep constructionbecause that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in humanhistory, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you'll be less suprisedby its actions.A few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write thehistory of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the an dynasty, roughlycontemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writingthe history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later an wrote of the earlier an and the entire periodbefore that; then later on they wrote about the Later an, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up theYuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty whichwas the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the publican volution of 1911; this isnow 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, 'The Official istory of the Qing dynasty'. When theformer Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. e said ""we told the scholarsnot to rush this project"". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. e said it would take manyyears, easily 10 years. I said, ""have you collected the material?"" e said yes. I asked, ""external sources?"" esaid yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled -24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Li's instruction to them was not to be too quick to drawconclusions!ao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. e overturned everything before but heknew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote witha terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on hiscommentaries and now it's all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own historybecause it's the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and theyhave seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romanticperiod of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: ""Below heaven, great movements, great currents, longdisunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity."" So they aept as a part of their own deep nature thatthere are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, youcould sense them feeling their own re-emergence, it's a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking inconfidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like anadolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who liveon the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greateror lesser degree envelope us.ow do we see China? I think to begin with, it's important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint,transpose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop aording to its own logic,aording to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictionsand one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at thebeginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes arecrushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeplyresistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius,because Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taipingvolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reachedits final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together withConfucius. That was the last paroxysm. day, u Jingtao said [in Mandarin e Xie She ui ], ""harmonioussociety"". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on thepattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and thelearning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the statecurriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important? Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with theyoung Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentratedeconomics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three presents, theprogressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now u Jingtao says ""harmonious society"",""peaceful re-emergence"". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion,towards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn.Joseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60's, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China,that great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation,the Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification thanthe West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to theirthinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to ammurabi, you maytrace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back,into its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it wasin an idea they call '1i' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, thatlaw is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must beoverridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must takeprecedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlierhistories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins inWestern Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;to them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a largerend. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.Democracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as auseful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. Soat the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate ofcandidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant ordespotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. Nodirect democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way toproduce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope isthrough universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The ParishCouncil, maybe, that's ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's against God's laws. Theyhave that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that toomuch democracy, invariably leads to 'localitis'; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are fromthe same villages whom we have a relationship with.We have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart fromSingapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimatecontrol of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to RobertKwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because theybelieve that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.This is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have theParsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis ofdeep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust localaffiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he wasborn. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can governSingapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost no province in China where the provincial leader is fromthat province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, it's as if routinely, the President of Franceis not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the public. And an Italiancannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is aepted as legitimate. If youare Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.This is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to bethere, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.So when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qingdynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules,governing the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you wereborn. You can't stay in a ministry for too long, you can't stay in a department for too long beacuse if you staytoo long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Ofcourse, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will acton those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one daythey will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is verydifficult in that situation to reverse it.So I mentioned at the table that for India, it's not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deepstructure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodicrevolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles andthey expect as a matter of course that the history of the People's public would not be written by the People'spublic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn't call it a dynasty,we are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be donemuch later.Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the upsand downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went toChina in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholicand a great mission would have been achieved. They never sueeded. Some of the brightest minds fromEurope went there. Matteo Rii, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he sawthe throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, it's in the compound ofthe Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. 'Li Matou', that's what hecalled himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then whenthe Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, ""the Manchus will bea bit more aomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China"". So if you read the despatches of themissionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance.They appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi.""Can we send more missionaries?"" ""No problem"". ""Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing""""No such thing"". The Emperor imposed one condition: ""you can send as many priests as you want to China butthey must die in China, they cannot leave after that"". You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see theCatholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And forwhom that loyalty is a jealous one.Mind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that youare left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers andprovincial secretaries, it's the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governingthis vast empire, whether we're talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about thesame number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And overthe appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. Ican anticipate the Vatican's argument that ""we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we arenot in conflict"". As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keepreligion at arm's length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, butin matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not aMuslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it waspossible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, andinfluenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that youcould get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society.I've talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China andforeign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because youare the experts in this field. I think it's very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are[Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other 'chopstickspeoples' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who arebeyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, theEuropeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on.Now all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with greathospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It remindedme of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treatedwell, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors betterthan your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.Those who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds,the universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, theSingaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen manytimes before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because,never in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, withthe US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountainswhich cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pureChinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinesewill be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that thereis an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fitconditions today.But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire todominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. Itbecame a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do theChina trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of theRussians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the imalayas, but mostly the Americansacross the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, theshine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they makepreparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the waythe European powers did in the past? I don't think so. I don't think there is a great desire to turn non-Chineseinto Chinese. be Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of theirgreater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians?  don'tthink they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while theirold nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, theywill develop their own responses to those threats.Quite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area whichthreatened them, historically. So they didn't worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes,they go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for theASEAN-China summit. e said, ""free trade agreement"". At that time when he announced it, the leaders ofASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. ok usalmost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, let's negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China wasassuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signedby Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. e said if after 10 years, theagreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine theAmerican USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal,it's settled for eternity. Then he said: ""China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia"", sohe acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from thebeginning. wards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy.wards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. wards America, it has become a relationshipbound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be avery difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in thiscentury. If it's badly managed there will be war, if it's properly managed there will be another generation ofpeace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area,you are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because it's noteasy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature.

Sidhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/12/david-miliband-gordon-brown-labour-leadership/printThe GuardianDavid Miliband: Labour is facing the fight of its lifeForeign secretary thought about quitting the government in last week's turmoilDavid Miliband expressed his frustration at a lack of vision from the Labour leadership. Photograph: MartinGodwinVoters still don't know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he revealshow close he came to quitting the government during last week's turmoil at Westminster.Speaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the party's highcommand was given an ""electric shock"" by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellowministers to get out and prepare for ""the fight of our life"".But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resignedfrom the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down.Miliband said: ""I'd made my decision on . Sometimes you can make your decisions with greatplanning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decisionin good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions.""The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. ""This divides people who are close andpeople feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way.""Describing the task now facing Labour, he says: ""It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11months until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came secondin Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs tothink: 'By God, we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the ries are they certainlydon't deserve a landslide' — then nothing will.""Miliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by ausationsthat he was manoeuvring for the premiership. e refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown lastweek saved the prime minister, saying ""it is impossible to tell"".But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motivesbeing questioned by anyone in Downing Street.Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: ""We need the message to go outthat we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong.""It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up topurpose. I know what we stand for, I know what our instincts are, but the voters don't. Actually, I know whatGordon Brown stands for.""We have a responsibility to make sure that, come the election, [voters] know what Labour stands for. We werenot being listened to, people felt that they had been forgotten, we neither inspired nor reassured.""e calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labour's fortunes. ""We needto make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet, but the whole of the labour movementare give n free rein because one in 20 people voted for us. The truth is that we are not automatons. We all haveto get out there.""Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: ""e himself has said he has tobuild on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. e is someone whomade the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignityfor what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerouspositions.""Providing what he describes as a route map from the disaster, he said: ""Labour first needs a period ofcompetent, effective, stable government; secondly, we need to reset our political compass so ministers are nolonger locked in their departments, but link their policies to their values; and thirdly, the government has to beat the cutting edge of policy.""On the issue of political reform, he demands a speeding-up of the pace of political reform, saying it is not apiece of middle-class frippery. For the first time, he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for theCommons, saying MPs' legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say 50% in my constituency voted forme.e says the change cannot be made before the general election. e also backs a fresh push on Lords reform,saying ""we have got an agreed blueprint"".e rounded on ry spending plans, but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election. ""Theywill be credible and clear. We will come to that in an open and honest way.""But he defends delay in setting out these figures, arguing ""when you are in the middle of a rnado it is a badtime take a forecast"".In an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings, he also calls on the media to abandon unattributablebriefings, saying all politicians' spokesmen should be named, or not quoted by media outlets. ""The gotchaculture of politics is not in anyone's interests,"" he said.Shop Dell's full line of Laptops now starting at $349!"

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues sheaddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches andenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.""This is possible,"" she said. ""You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.""Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some ofAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government toprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how theSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the manyinroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton waspassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.""The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer forthat conflict,"" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. ""er commitment toaddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to theusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.""""Now,"" he added, ""comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectationsengendered by her visit.""In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen JohnsonSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19thcentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberantwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loudfunny noises whenever she said something striking.""I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,"" she said.In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a countrythat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped theturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found inCanctIn or the Bahamas.Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde ""a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.""On , just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, ""I bring you greetings from President Obama.""She called him a ""son of Africa"" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined tohelp Africa reach its promise.###"

And the reaction I have heard today has been verypositive.Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel asI understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There aretwo ways:1.  describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has aepted an Israeli completion of ahandful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It wouldrepresent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and itwould trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts aboutour effectiveness.2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of asettlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number ofhousing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which wehave expressed to them..•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrantsan immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will helppromote a two-state solution.This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to moveforward.Of course, I am around if you want to discuss.Good luck in India.

2471,2472,1330,12,49.0,376,2,1,2,"Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the keyparagraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war andsubsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect  1,1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --although the power of the U.S. to deny aess to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is tocontinue in perpetuity.The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economicdevelopment.A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief presentative for Compact view JoshuaKoshiba, Minister of ealth Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassadorto the U.S. ersey Kyota, presentative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in onolulu on 8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary view with an American delegation that included Department of State Officeof Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives ofthe Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number ofthe U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as wellas the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibilitycommitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in theU.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions inthe U.N.Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positiveexpressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both politicalparties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and topositions befitting the great nation that is the United States.cognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and thatthe U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officialscan be needed.Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive toelaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment toofficial communications.B6"

""We are notagainst a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,"" Japan's Kyodo news agencyquoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son o as saying . But the ambassador, speaking inNew York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,China and Russia, saying ""the six-party talks are gone forever."" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North withinthe six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Lastweekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between NorthKorea and the U.S. were slim. ""Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collectiveapproach"" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks ""cheated""North Korea, ausing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No moredetails were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment . The North Korean mission to theU.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in  to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocketlaunch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-rangemissile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in  and a barrage of missile tests in , drawinginternational condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea'snuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. ""North Korea willbe a significant topic, but obviously one among many,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said  inWashington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of Stateillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to ""small children"" demanding attention. Ata regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North ""has no friends left."" North Korea's ForeignMinistry described her  as ""a funny lady"" who sometimes ""looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes apensioner going shopping.""298"

Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor andtwo nurses, falsely ausing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers werefound innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition tomake abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenyahas one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seekingthe procedure, often through dangerous means.Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitutionby next year. ligious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution whichwould codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetalpersonhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such aprovision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the AfricanUnion's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development andreproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regainthe momentum of stability and suess it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be aregression for women's rights and for the country writ large.I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutionalamendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics andproviders in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in postabortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell youhow poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant governmentharassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safemedical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issuewhen you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope thatif Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would behappy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is alsoa Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of  8th and we are working on them to have a sidemeeting on this issue as well.As always, thank you so much for all you do.

2563,2564,1371,144,67.0,107,2,1,2,"Gentlemen, for your information below.WernerGFC whom it may concern from experience speaking!RSO Niall,Please be aware and as you have requested my elaboration in written format. As brieflydiscussed in the meeting today, the LGF operate at what I would consider the ""Threshold'Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning, that our work schedule, hours and sleeping pattern'the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.,,time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,:LGF's ability to provide security. better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.Snap shot of an average day for a shift:1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with ""In-Service Training"". .IConvoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx iduring the day) followed by actual convoy movement.2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site,3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site.4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. sliithen actual convoy movement5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment aredown loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is aounted for andsecured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watchmovie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc.7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers titwake-up and grooming and breakfast.This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a,hours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usuallymeals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings intonight shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the eveningbriefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and areagain with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea ione good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, foltwo more night shifts).When finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They thehave to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designatedtraining day. Third day is a scheduled off day.If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio',from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establishrhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiekover the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt,of energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:..after 5 and 6 weeks.In summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.spectfully, Werner TheGuard Force Commander US Embassy, Kabul AfghanistanArmorGroup North AmericaTel: (+93) 0777715903 (+93) 0799715903ilicstate.gov or"

This can be usedfor the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will askthe Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the ForeignPress Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is askedso we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJBEGIN TEXTQuestions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State illary Clinton on  30 before the UnitedNations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.garding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficultconflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into thisdecade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape andsexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This wasthe basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment ofdetainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have inother conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of themilitary conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on thepromotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. TheUnited States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges."

Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorizedto. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because itcould undermine national stability.Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number ofpolling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eideand others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities couldbe smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.""And, I've included below Jane Smiley's rave review of Max's book.Sidhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.htmlYour request is being processed...Jane SmileyPulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistPosted:  uffPost Book view: publican GomorrahAbout twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gunwent off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. e never said, ""I shot aman."" It just happened.I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,publican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the publican partywho does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No publican is an agent of his or her ownsuess or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,unhinged behavior every time a publican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense ofpowerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about themurderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matterhow well armed, never felt it.publican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the variouspublican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, anddamning others who either don't aept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Ofcourse that is frightening.But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including Johnagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph ed, Charles Colson, Judith isman, Christina gnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even thoseof us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about thepower that they wish to exert.Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes thenetwork. e shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected toErik Prince is connected to Ralph ed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to m Delay is connectedto ny Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course oftracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people havecommitted.Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--didhe not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel inNew Orleans where publicans ""wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--publicans haveimpeable taste in silk stockings"" (the madam is talking about men). publican Gomorrah is full of crimes--both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted aggard's, and those we haven't (there is goodevidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, orderedhits on his estranged wife, and sueeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of AJustified Sinner by James ogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin hewants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was ""saved,"" for example, he said, ""My goal is to get toheaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way."" e must havethought getting to heaven was just another power play.And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing thatBlumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in thestrongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about goingafter the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in ""the most vicious fight ever stagedbetween man and beast."" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until ""he wants(s) to crumple onthe breast of his parent."" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,over the years, has suessfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthalcites Erich m's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Ericoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of thesepowerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessonsabout God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that hesurpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shameand guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself e will then take his place in thehierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared byliberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in histhirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has beeninterviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, howconstant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. Ithink he looks within, and says, ""I'm okay; you're okay."" That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tellby statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and ourrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that havesex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes nosense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to tryto figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conformingto a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group canbe anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terrorcan only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he isdefined as powerless. When he ""crumples"" on the ""loving"" breast of his parent (and in my view a person whoadministers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he aepts hispowerlessness and he also aepts that power is what defines this life.That's where your freedom and mine come in.Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Talibanonly in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to nevershare power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeplyhierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocideof 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. Inhis book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for ""disobedient children, unchastewomen, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers,"" and homosexuals. Gary North, thePresbyterian Christian constructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass deathpenalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is afactor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of youand me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to aeptresponsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we ""crumple"" on his""loving"" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these ChristianDominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is ""Adore me or I will hurt you.""Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physicalpunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge abouteffective methods.

I soon realized that my motives for administering physicalpunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge abouteffective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than theparents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works withhorses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two andtwo together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a Godwho was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologicallyunstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted aggard. But they have numbers. The bad thingabout that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-O) brought us ""back from thebrink"" aording to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that theywould not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing isthat they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia andGermany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and itlerdidn't have nuclear weapons.I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. e probablyhad no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand asseparate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label thatwere terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, hewished someone, somehow, had stopped him.Don't forget to buy one: Max Blumenthal, publican Gomorrah, Nationbooks, available at your localbookstore and anywhere else thatbooks are sold.ad more at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah b 290293.html"

2657,2658,109,0,46.0,233,2,1,2,": Berger, Samuel R.RC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over thePakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and,while I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts.-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target someAQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and moreabout with whom AQ is imbedded..-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they wantto cultivate in the event we ""leave"" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen thatbefore and will hedge their bets.-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we candisabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanisto go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistandominated by the Taliban.-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted againstmilitary leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, wecan go after bank aounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raisingthe stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Bluntermeasures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Giventhe level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing ofthe U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult forthe Pakistani people to aept.-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Ofcourse, the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list thesedays but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting oureffort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be asforward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training,whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible todemonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used canbe played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the useof these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to pressthem on AQ.-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could takethat would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus onthreats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidencebuilding measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduceuncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy? the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they couldsee such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.Sandy"

SidDear Madame Secretary,It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entireaudience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time weare both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that hasbeen hugely suessful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers andpulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with localcompanies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide thesecurity. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certifiedlinemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation andcertification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center inTanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distributionprojects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion doesand how it does it.I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doingmuch of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The factthat we have been suessful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies thathave been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is todemonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also goodbusiness.I look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and verymuch appreciate your generosity.With warm regards and best wishes.Joe"

Patrick Cockburn, ofthe London Independent, is one of the best informed on-the-ground journalists. e was almost always correct onIraq. SidPatrick Cockburn:  say this war must be wonin a year is nonsensehttp://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won-in-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html, 8  2009SPONSORED LINKS:Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night skyas the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of firefrom Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining downon them.It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of theAfghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In themeantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missedthe point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of aTaliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicleshad all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many menthe Taliban had lost, I was told ""none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they justran away.""Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of militarycrisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commanderin Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost inthe next twelve months.This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years becausethey have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness ofPresident amid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtuncommunity, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficultyadvancing into areas oupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,azara or Uzbek majority.Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but thereis no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflictquite small military losses on the US which are politically unaeptable back home. They can do thisthrough roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it wasbeing used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territorysupposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to beingsuddenly targeted by the other side.It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. ButAfghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as moreof the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equippedmilitary force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show thatTaliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed byAmerican shells and bombs.So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. e is not going to win or lose the war in the nextyear. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable tosuggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flackjackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weekstraining. Many of them did not come back.One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paidproperly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is notenough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid toforeign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properlyreally did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent ofmen are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while theAfghan government is dependent on foreign aid.The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama shouldbe considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops."

Please let me know if youwould like any further information.Thanks,MikeUnited States Institute of Peace: BackgroundProposals for the creation of a government ""peace"" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a ""PeaceOffice"" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress toestablish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established theCommission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict solution. In 1981, the Commission — knownas the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peaceacademy. In 1984, President agan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Boardof Directors took place in 1986.The USIP Act established ""an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Governmentthrough the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peaceinformation services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations andpeoples of the world without recourse to violence.""USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policyresearch, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitatedialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, andeducating the public through events, films, and other outreach.O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,Korea, Iran, Iraq, and aiti.® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent CongressionalCommission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.Michael .

We're getting it around to friends & family, along withPeople op-ed and NYT Mag q&a - was a great weekend in terms of positive press.It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where illary Clinton Is?By David RothkopfWashington Post,  23, 2009When it comes to illary Rodham Clinton, we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidentialcandidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-illary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, whiledepicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton'sweight and hair, while her ""defense"" of illary in her essay ""Obama's Other Wife"" was as sexist as the title suggests.Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturingoutrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamousquestion regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,which covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White ouse, or TheWashington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer ofchoice for the secretary of state.Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes inU.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalizedState Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite thepessimists who invoked the ""team of rivals"" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,illary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes totough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. cognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White ouse,she is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept America's leaders awake allnight.In these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways inwhich her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficultpersonnel approvals or disputes with the White ouse about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of alladministrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama's centrality amplifies the importance ofhis closest White ouse staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard olbrooke (onAfghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton'srole.Given the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White ouse would have a bigger day-to-day hand insome of the nation's most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, VicePresident Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problemsof the recent past, Clinton's State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- inparticular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: Itrecognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama's vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of theMiddle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia --are rivals as well? ow must America's alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? ow do we engage with roguestates and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? ow dowe move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstateplayers and once-disenfranchised peoples?In searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recentspeech at the Council on Foreign lations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the newadministration's worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include ""partnership"" and""engagement"" and ""common interests."" Clearly, Madeleine Albright's ""indispensable nation"" has recognized theindispensability of collaborating with others.Who those ""others"" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. ""We will put,"" Clinton said,""special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey,Indonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda."" This is the death knell for the G-8 as thehead table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the suessor tothe G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waningdays of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from atraditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world's sole superpower.Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this yearand will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in . Clinton has made trips toChina and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africaand the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world.On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emergingpowers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, we've seen a new American willingness to play down olddifferences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on humanrights.At the center of Clinton's brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School ofPublic and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideasin Clinton's speech. ""We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks,coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems,"" she told me."" do that,"" Slaughter continued, ""our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to communityorganizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind ofdiplomacy.""A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obama'stechnology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. is mission isto harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networkshave played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whetherthrough a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money forPakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.Of course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary hasbrought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in FoggyBottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, suchas Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreachworldwide and dd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.Even just a few months in, it's clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and theacting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the newQuadrennial Diplomacy and Development view, an initiative modeled on the Pentagon's strategic assessments anddesigned to review State's priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world,notably with China. Clinton made women's issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressedthat ""the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent thatundermines progress and prosperity.""Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs Internationalvice chairman Robert ormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the StateDepartment, as well as Judith Mcale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. Inthe same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India's privatesector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping theself-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The oldcampaign teams -- Clinton's and Obama's -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by mostaounts, the administration's national security team has come together suessfully, with Clinton developing strongrelationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. er policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, hasrenewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser m Donilon; the two of them, working with Obamacampaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Departmentseventh-floor dweller called ""a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking."" enry Kissinger mayhave overstated matters when he said this is the best White ouse-State relationship in recent memory, but it's not bad,while the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.At the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration's talk ofinternational partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all.So far, aording to multiple high-level officials at State and the White ouse, the two seem aligned in their views. Inaddition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson onforeign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoedhis points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling,the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state hasspoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.It is still early, and a president's foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to theunexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention orreluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory ""smart power"" alreadydoes to me.Nevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obama's unlikely secretary of state is supporting andaugmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama's ""other wife,"" not as Bill Clinton's wife, not even as a celebrity or as aformer presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of ""Superclass:The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making"" and ""Running the World: The Inside Story of the NSC and theArchitects of American Power."" e will be online to chat with readers  at 11 a.m. Submit your questions andcomments before or during the discussion."

As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, aguesaid: ""This is a respectable party in Latvia ...  suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.""Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the ry links.The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be aused of interference in UK politics orissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: ""I can say that the two had a good, wide-rangingdiscussion on a broad range of issues, but can't get into details or substance of that discussion.""ague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play alesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.ague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, theBalkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.""No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of stateClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those,"" ague said.""I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as asmear campaign against some of its members.""e noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism inEurope and had just completed a suessful visit to Israel. ""These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,""ague said.As for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, ""five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration thathave been criticised."" Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance, the European People's party.On Conservative Euroscepticism, ague said: ""I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important todistinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ...

Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of SouthCarolina.A freshman on the Foreign lations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMintis best known for boasting that health care would be the ""Waterloo"" that will ""break"" Obama. e recentlyprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to onduras to ""assess"" the crisis.The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist whowas expelled by the military in . Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his ""intransigence""in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially deniedmoney for DeMint's trip. But Senate publican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through theDefense Department.""DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order todefend a coup,"" says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for InternationalPolicy.""Little onduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy byprovoking the [DeMint] holds,"" Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreignlations, told me. Some ill staffers are even blunter: ""These losers from the Bush administration who droveLatin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy,"" one aide told The Daily Beast.A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin Americanpolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stanceagainst the president installed by the onduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire toappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration ""slow-walked"" itsresponse to the coup this summer, Sweig says.More recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least$35 million and blocking onduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter intoserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washingtonand helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelayalegal and PR battles in onduras before the coup. Among them: Otto ich, a Cuban-American who headed theState Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and wassubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, whichfound he engaged in ""prohibited covert activities"" by using public funds to attack agan's critics. ich, whowas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western emisphere Affairs andis now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.""Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelayacoup,"" he told me by phone from Panama. e disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as ""crap,""asserting they were only based on a fired ouse staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a LatinAmerican history professor at NYU, has a darker view of ich's role: ""It's kind of the origins of SwiftBoating,"" he says. ""It's all related to what he's doing now.""Conservative supporters of the current onduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against theworldwide condemnation of the coup. ""It's not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,""ich told me. e has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, takingThe New York Times to task for an article last  that he says implied he was being paid to lobby onbehalf of the Micheletti regime. ""I guess my facts interfered with [the] story,"" he says. ""Can you believe someof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?"" ADeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with ich to talk about onduras, although a ich aidesays they've spoken to DeMint's staff.Adding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservativessay are unproven conspiracy theories that ich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. ehas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: ""I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy chargesagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya."" But the rumors may add to his auraof power as founder of Otto ich Associates. e's drawn more attention to the new onduras allegations bypenning a column for the Miami erald boldly headlined, ""I Did rchestrate Coup in onduras.""Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing onduran-American lawyerMiguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by theSenate. In addition to ich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles ininfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the onduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aideto the late Sen. Jesse elms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign lations Committee) who also served as anassistant secretary for Western emisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On  2, Noriega appeared on TheNewsour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new onduran regime. e was identified as a formerambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.Noriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a onduran business group only in mid-. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of onduran Manufacturers to set up meetingsbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early . That visit toWashington by onduran business and political figures from  2 to  10, Foreign Policy reported,ourred at the same time as a ouse committee hearing during which ich—along with a former onduransupreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testifiedin favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign lations Committee hearings on Obama'spicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western emisphereAffairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of GeorgetownUniversity's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the NationalSecurity Council during President Clinton's second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Westernemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign lations Committeein late . Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign lations observes, ""They're not polarizing figures.""But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the  8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMintby defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: ""In my studies of militarycoups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup,"" Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he hascontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,including the promise of an extensive floor debate on onduras before a floor vote on the nominees.DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about animportant crisis. ""If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn't Senator id broughtthem to the floor?"" he asks. ""There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote onthem."" Technically that's true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has takenup the issue of onduras, Denton claims, because, ""the State Department's actions were directly relevant to twonominees seeking the committee's approval.""Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on onduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to ""break""Obama—one congressional observer jokes, ""e couldn't find onduras on a map.""Art Levine, a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly, has written for Mother Jones, The AmericanProspect, The New public, The Atlantic, Slate.com, Salon. corn, and numerous other publications. e alsoblogs regularly on labor, health, and other reform issues for In These Times and uffington Post.For inquiries, please contact The Daily Beast at editorial@thedailybeast.com."

STATE 86734B. STATE 825811.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.2.(SBU) On  14, the USG and Colombian governmentprovisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of abilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota inabout a month, following a final review by both sides. Asnoted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United Statesaess to several Colombian military bases and facilitateeffective bilateral cooperation on security matters inColombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of anyU.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overallincrease in the number of U.S. military personnel orU.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.3.(SBU) On  18, the Secretary and Colombian FMJaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,including the importance of coordinating our publicaffairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).There is some concern that the upcoming Union of SouthAmerican Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regionalreferendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribewill attend the summit provided that a full range ofregional security matters can be discussed, not just theDCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selectedUNASUR members to ask that they raise other regionalsecurity issues beyond the DCA.4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, andLima: that you find an opportunity prior to the  28summit to raise the importance of discussing the fullrange of regional security topics during the summit, andnot merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of hostgovernment.2655. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors toUNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from theSecretary to host governments in advance of the  28summit.6. (U) Begin text:Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:I wanted to take a moment to write to you and yourcolleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of SouthAmerican Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for  28 inBariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to addressthe issues and challenges that affect the region. TheUnited States supports the formation and effectivefunctioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. Theypromote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,and ensure the best possible communication betweennations.As you know, our common neighbor,Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholyalliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidiousillegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatenedthe security of average Colombians and sought to overthrowby violence and corruption suessive,democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actionsof these groups also threaten the security of othercountries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in manyways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians havebeat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. Mycountry is proud of the role we have been able to play inthis effort.This battle is far from won. Our governments and peopleare collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselvesand our institutions from such threats. I am certainthese very issues will be addressed at the upcomingsummit, including the recently concluded DefenseCooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand thesensitivities associated with U.S. military activities inthe hemisphere and the questions your government may haveregarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hopethe efforts made in the last few weeks by both mygovernment and the Colombian government have helpedaddress those questions.I would like to take this opportunity to make several keypoints about the DCA. First, this agreement is abilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen ourcooperation on security challenges within Colombia,permitting U.S. aess to specified agreed Colombian26fifacilities to undertake mutually agreed activities onColombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement thatdoes not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of othernations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combatdrug trafficking benefit the security of the region as awhole. The agreement does not permit the establishment ofU.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increasein the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do notseek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or fromColombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated inadvance by Colombian authorities. All activities will bebased on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,territorial integrity of states, andnon-interventionism.We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible inaddressing concerns about this bilateral agreement withnations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so inrecent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concernsor questions arise, I hope that you will feel free toreach out to us to seek clarification.The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for theorganization to address a range of security issues thataffect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership fordeciding to discuss these matters. The securitychallenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations inparticular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief isthat a collective and collaborative approach to thesematters is essential. It is our commitment to work withUNASUR nations to help address these concerns.Sincerely yours,illary Rodham ClintonEnd text."

Good luck at the UNGA.President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America'sallies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one heinherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed tocounter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar inthe Czech public was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rocketsthat could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America'sally Turkey, unprotected.Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a fewlong-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose animmediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forcesstationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defencecapability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-rangeIranian missiles in the future.The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarmshould recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credibleone strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts theresuspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be usedoffensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenariowas not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. owever,by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president hasimproved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway inGeneva.Those talks could produce by  a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on trackfor further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal ofeliminating nuclear weapons.As they and their suessors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with astark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side beingvulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump theother side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will beon hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initiallysceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensivecapability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to aseries of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons wereexpected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald aganwas not. The late US president championed the development of a space-basedcomprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutualdeterrence — ""impotent and obsolete.""Many experts believed agan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, wasan impossible dream. So did his suessor, George . W. Bush, who treated the programwith benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms ductionTalks (START) begun by Mr agan.The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. e greatly weakened theSTART process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a nationalmissile defence (NMD) system. is decision to build the interceptor and radar sites inPoland and the Czech public was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in largemeasure about ""pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.""Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studiedarms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences andregulation of defences. owever, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of lastweek's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its ownmerits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fightswith the publicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate theprinciples of the ABM treaty.Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulatingstrategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will beeither impossible or, worse, dangerous.The author is president of the Brookings Institution."

Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways andMeans Committee despite his ethics problems. Aording to amended forms recently filed with the ouse, Rangel failedto disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a ouse ethics investigation into hisfailure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican public and his ties to a real-estate developerwho leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising andwhether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of NewYork. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its aounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post andBuffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington eights last , Rangelsaid that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. ""Some Americans have notgotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'ow did this happen?' ""Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.""Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live ashuman beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,"" he said. Afterthe forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. ""What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hallmeetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry withtheir member of Congress, period,"" he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Patersonclaimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is raciallydriven. The White ouse disagreed with Paterson's comments.120Little League World Series - Staten Island's little league team, the South Shore Nationals, made it to the Little LeagueWorld Series, but they lost the title two weeks ago with a 4-1 loss to the Southwest gional Champs, McAllister ParkAmerican, from San Antonio.9/11 - Jay Winuk, founder of the My Good Deed organization, and brother of 9/11 victim, Glenn Winuk, notified us thatDOJ has finally award his brother the 9/11 eroes Medal of Valor.

2974,2975,1536,12,9.0,254,2,1,2,"MagazineThe Power GridBack  the Death Panel ow the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White ouse,returned from the brink.•Published Oct 11, 2009On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-carebill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over thelegislation instead. ""It's just too weak,"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no realcompetition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of thebill. is political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead,"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucusplan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyonegives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known morefor his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, asWeiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close tononexistent. And yet, since , when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisypheaninto the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearestand savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever billeventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-carepaper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion hasbeen more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I havea long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégéand we played on the same Capitol ill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, inother words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as amatter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother shipthat was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out therespeaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfortwith the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuumthat he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness anddeath of Ted Kennedy and the migration of illary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate ofwhat would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;he is engaged to uma Abedin, illary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and thishas become my issue,"" Weiner says. ""If illary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows thathe's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of thecleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, anequation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the publican howls against a""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White ousepursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistentlyclear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's  speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that ""up tonow, the messaging from the White ouse has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every coupleof hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,"" he tellsme.Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to hisconsistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back toWashington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy"

Photograph: Jason ed/ufersGordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after itemerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street tohold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due toill health or deteriorating eyesight.There have been tensions between the White ouse and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottishgovernment's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in NewYork were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a jointpress conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin ofinternational diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine fluimmunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as theysat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as futureeconomic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: ""Ido say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.""But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, u Jintao, the Russianpresident, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio atoyama.News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw aparliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after shewas fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretaryCharles Clarke.Stephen esford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: ""In my view, the facts of thecase do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall isuncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be aountable.""Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadershiprisked letting ""the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of  2010 [the expected date of the generalelection] and sink for a very long time"". e said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. ""Ithink his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.""In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. ""My sight is not at alldeteriorating,"" he told NBC.Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: ""I am healthyand I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.""I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.""In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bushadministration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama willfocus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: ""The time has come for the world to move ina new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.""Last week, the White ouse had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that hedisapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had nothighlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero'swelcome as he returned to Tripoli.Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-key had been broken.In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against ColonelGaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security councilshould be renamed ""the terror council"".Brown countered in his speech in New York later: ""I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I callon everyone to support its universal principles.""e urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorismthat were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: ""If we miss this opportunity to protect ourplanet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective globalagreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change weare inflicting on future generations.""e added: ""If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies aregoing to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stopdeforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.""No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were""without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are havinga number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night'sclimate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on  on Pakistan and thefight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summitin Pittsburgh."""

3025,3026,1559,0,7.0,225,2,1,2,"Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'specialrelationship' sinks to new lowGordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obamaduring his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release ofthe Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New YorkPublished: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policychange in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.But the White ouse rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearingon his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New Yorkkitchen.The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White ouse were at their lowest pointsince John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite thePresident hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed thatthis was not unusual.owever, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White ouse's refusal to meet Mr Brown hadbeen a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,"" the source said.""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy onsupplying swine flu vaines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, aording to a seniorsource. owever, the meeting never happened.The White ouse said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would""spend all day  together."" owever, 's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of worldleaders.The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind thenew chill in relations between Washington and London.Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.Downing Street's original aount of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, familiesof victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, madespeeches.Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White ouse and pointed to an informaldiscussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on  night. The15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building inManhattan.No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meetingwith Mr Obama.In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20anew era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis onrelations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poorrelationship with the White ouse contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor ny Blair, who enjoyed closefriendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.John Major's ry government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major hadtried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton'sstudent past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled toNew York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead ofjustice for victims families.The Prime Minister was also aused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in orderto safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y thanhuman rights.Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guestspaid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, enry Kissinger and the pop star Bono."

Some examples of the work thus far:• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through theconsolidation of efforts under ny Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) ofassistance contracts.•• olbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of theSwat refugee crisis.•• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-borderissues.)11• olbrooke's international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of otherspecial representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, morebuy-in, and more patience.olbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan andPakistan. ere are some examples:IllDefining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)• The regional approach championed by olbrooke became a central feature of the idelreport; the trilats are a pure olbrooke inventionAfghanistanThe clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced ""Afghanization"" -primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferablealternative to adding more troops.• The idel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;olbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers andspeed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,particularly with respect to the police.Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:•Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuingreconciliation/reintegration.• The idel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate""non ideologically-committed"" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,and aept the Afghan Constitution. olbrooke was key in developing this aspect of thereport, and is now working through the next phases.Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction• The idel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendantneed to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey• The idel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region.

I just checked and ironically the figure comes from Melanne's testimony during an SFRChearing, where she stated: """"The scale and enormity of the violence directed at women [in the DRCI can scarcely beadequately described. Some 1100 rapes are being reported each month, with an average of 36 women and girls rapedevery day."". Triple checking the origins.illary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'Originally posted    EDTSecretary of State illary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the formerFirst Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton'sthoughts on a trade issue (""My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,"" she retorted), the emotional heart of hertour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rapevictims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -and what she will do about it.What I Saw in GomaBy illary Rodham ClintonIn 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, aprovincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violentconflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informalmilitias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safehaven.Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whateverglimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of theirhomes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence hasbecome a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with anaverage of 36 women and girls raped every day.I visited a hospital run by the organization eal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two oftheir children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Thenthey beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managedto get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them andabet them. They are crimes against humanity.These acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves ustogether as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen healthcare workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the woundedin Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who havebeen raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded eal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital inBukavu, represent humanity at its best.The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding toprevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic public of Congo. We will provide medical care,counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officersto protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women andfront-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. Andwe will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assistsurvivors of sexual violence.While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that theperpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly importantwhen they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to committhese crimes with impunity.Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will notend with my departure.We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in theeastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring anend to this conflict.There is an old Congolese proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come."" The day mustcome when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children andcollect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They arestrong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make theircountry both peaceful and prosperous.Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese peopleseize the opportunities of a new day."

3085,3086,422,0,2.0,212,2,1,2,"See below. Will send PIR comments shortly.: CDMFr: Caitlin: Branch BookOverview:There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises"" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pickup on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosedinformation about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot ofthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring andmuch more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as ""and this day, and the next day"" as My Life,it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact thatthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJCquotes was far fewer than I had expected.RC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. er role is largely seen through her interactions withBranch when he is recording WJC. er statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of theGephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included RC's devotion to CVC, thoughtthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty muchaligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed inthe book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinionof the Administration and events of the time. e clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example hisconnection with the events in aiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that arestrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did notappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passagesabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but youwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and hischronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple oasions.The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branchcould write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,later quashed, who slept over while RC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White ouse. Branch doesportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacksWhitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated fromWhitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, suchas WJC referring to Paula Jones as ""a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.""Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, noother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reasonhe didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time ifshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is avery small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing thisbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationshipwith Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship withJanet no. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issuesare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and RC is portrayedin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of herrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, aiti. (Note: Much of what is written aboutaiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussionabout North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed inwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than thisbook.In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that theUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be ""defenseless"" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streetswould be lined with ""assassins."" There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationshipbetween some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of olbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin'sdrinking, such as yelling outside of Blair ouse for a cab to get pizza.One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recordersgoing, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with RC'sGephardt comment.The following items are addressed in the memo:Wen o Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4WJC and Lewinsky's Silence 4RC and Kissinger 4RC and gay/lesbian 5Tension with Moynihan 5RC as World Player 5Jesse Jackson 6Tension with Janet no 6Portrayal of Carter 7lationship with Gore 8Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, RC and aiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap,Subpoenas of CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex, Gore/RC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin runfor Senate, Trip to South Asia) 11Wen o Lee and Terror Clause of Crime BillIn discussing Wen o Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strainedinterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a ""confession."" My Lifeonly mentions Lee's ausation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages fromBranch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the securityagencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen o Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to hispersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets toChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored theirtreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him morethan to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others ""were being held in secret, unchargedand untried...e [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law withoutforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within thelegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise.  hisdismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extremedetention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We aept guiltypeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]WJC and Lewinsky's SilenceBranch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it couldsend her to jail, as she had denied it.➢ ""Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial ofthe affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr couldhave turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, whileoriginal, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for hissteadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's aount."" [Branch, 511]RC and KissingerThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling EleanorRoosevelt.➢ There is a passage in which RC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where hecomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued tosay ""it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. isvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over becausethe Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it'sdead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in illary's dream, it registered thathis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'illary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'[Branch, 179]RC and gay/lesbianWriting about a call with RC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very ""exercised."" WJC leftthe room. ""e was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my lifethan illary.' e sighed. er temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issueswere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation."" [Branch, 551]Tension with MoynihanThere are several oasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration withMoynihan. For example:> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia couldfight for themselves, Branch writes, ""The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just afreebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'"" [p.140]> In regard to health care: ""Echoing comments by illary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihanfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme."" [p.170]➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: ""She [RC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted anumber of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he wassure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihanskated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutinyhimself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the PennsylvaniaAvenue Development Corporation."" [Brach, 182]➢ ""Donnybrook"" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regrettedhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, ""e doesn't understand...that he'sconceding the principles."" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the pressand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by ""feeding the beast of hostile presumption aboutClinton's motives."" [Branch, 299]RC as World PlayerThere are several images as RC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Severalexamples follow:➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King ussein: ""They had retreated for lunch as two couples—theClintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was adelicate race between ussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The presidentsaid he and illary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, waterdisputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. usseingave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point."" [Branch, 170]> South Asia: garding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, ""er [RC's] schedule was far moredemanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtroddenwomen."" [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and RC. ""By contrast witha superficial American press, which portrayed illary as a demure tourist of no policy significance inexotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements forcitizenship groups and small-scale economic development."" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds toa NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, ""she [RC] played the traditional role of FirstLady as wife and mother..."") [Branch, 246]> China Speech: Branch outlines how RC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how shedepicted the ""harsh reality everywhere"" from China to Africa. e then cites WJC commenting on therave reviews of RC's speech. [Branch, 289]➢ garding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes ""Yeltsin seemed so removed fromurgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly."" [Branch, 512-513]Jesse JacksonBranch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contactwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCsgratitude, but the fact that Jackson ""counseled"" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.➢ ""But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he calledChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. ow he got it wasanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened inAmerican politics. e did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how muchher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,rage, or pray, he was always available."" [Branch, 497]Tension with Janet noThroughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negativeopinion of Janet no.> ""e complained about Janet no—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorneygeneral. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996campaign finance] would fall to no's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share no'swholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become atarget...If he removed both no and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protestlike Nixon's  Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.That was not an option."" [Branch, 388-389]> Branch writes about WJC talking about no and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato andcontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and no. no had made public statements about her""desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn'thire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'"" [Branch,398] e continues to outline that Clinton did give no credit for some good achievements includingcoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,but that ""he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, lettingmandates multiply almost at will. She aepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. nohad failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extensionthe entire executive branch...e told me she had no clue what he meant. is advisers considered hermore naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her."" [Branch, 399] e citesthat Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire secondterm.Portrayal of Jimmy CarterThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip toNorth Korea and the mission he went on to aiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to beon the front lines.North Korea:➢ ""On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extremeisolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allowinspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, addinggratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White ouseseething, but Clinton made light of the spat. e said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,162]aiti:➢ After pushing to be sent to aiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break withGore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission toaiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'(arguing for aeptance of aitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). edidn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went tothe press first. ""The three negotiators flew back to Washington late , and Carter, invited to stayover at the White ouse, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the nextmorning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was notright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominentnegotiators...e said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment toClinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clintonfound this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, heallowed, exhibiting a keen political ear... Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right tospeak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had aepted for the United Statesgovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, butClinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. e considered Carter a sterling ex-resident."" [Branch, 200-201]Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq➢ ""e expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, agan andBush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but hedoesn't have much positive to say."" [Branch, 518]GoreFor the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few placeswhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes theseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.➢ On page 92 Branch writes, ""No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, asalleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviserny Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary LesAspin."" [Branch, 92]➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of azel O'Leary and alsohaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as othernations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan toredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in , but WJC""pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Goreerupted. e thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were stillwrangling about dates for Japan."" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC sawLewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working asa team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and RC about Gore trying to hire a secondcriminal lawyer. RC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation isabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. ""The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for hiskickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches weretechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. is twofold message was perfect: distinguish himselffrom Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White ouse.The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would bebadgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, Iwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'"" [Branch, 553-554]Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of hiscampaign. ""On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and toGore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, preciselyhow and where he would lead the country—because the publicans would try to knock him offsubstance."" [Branch, 554]➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore notsueeding him. For example, ""Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,experience, and motivated. e examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidentialcharacter over detailed agendas for the country. porters called Gore ""stiff,"" but Clinton discountedthis liability. e thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also wasperceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore toemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a broodingquality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious naturefailed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word ""sunny."" Gore needed more of it."" [Branch, 599]➢ e also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. ""Gore knew Washington. Believeme, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years hadit not been for the vice president."" e then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone whowould be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes intogreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. ow much of thiswas WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the suesses of the administration. ""They should be runningessentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record wouldtarnish them with Clinton's character."" [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debatethat had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where ""Gore had bared himself in oneof their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that hemeant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blendthe two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...ehad the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehowwithout seeming to brag on his own record."" [Branch, 623-624]➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsureat first about recording the details. At the outset it says, ""For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor didhe blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around himdid."" [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in theWhite ouse. Then he says, ""'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'""Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,now that we're being honest.'"" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that""Clinton's drag plagued every direction."" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance thanClinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an ""unparalleled"" vicepresident, but that he had ""blind spots."" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was""surreal.""o Gore had a ""fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raisingscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personalintegrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore saidhe had not been disposed to blame Clinton. owever, he remembered telling the president thathe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And thepresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations fortrouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe theensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thoughthe was in Neverland,' he said."" [Branch, 643-644]o Branch continues: ""The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. e had supportedClinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himselfdisappointed. Yes, said the president. e appreciated that. owever, persisted Gore, Clinton didnot confide any personal feelings. e never explained exactly what happened. There was little tosay, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. e was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.e had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a doubletake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both ofthem angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significanthere?...Gore exploded back. e was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayedhonesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..."" [Branch,644-45]Other➢ Maggie as Person commending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC askingMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. ""Williams was shrewd, discreet,and efficient."" [Branch, 161]> RC and aiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what RC thought about his foreign policy team'ssuggestion to invade aiti. ""e said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. acting against thepressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreignpolicy staff. e said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby RayInman as defense secretary."" [Branch, 189]> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that RC had not written the book.Quinn said that RC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.RC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White ouse had draftchapters in RC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as aghostwriter.)  this RC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that RC and a femaleveterinarian of Socks' were ""discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White ouse."" [Branch,342-343]> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, hadsubpoenaed all those who might have been in the White ouse when RC's Rose firm records werethere. This included ""some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers."" Senator Sarbanes quashed thesubpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, ""In ourglancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described aslighthearted or recreational."" [Branch, 495]> Gore/RC ticket: ""By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-illary ticket would give Democrats theirbest chance to defeat Bush for the White ouse. 'ands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Alwould ever do it.'"" [Branch, 540]> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supportingRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether thetwo events are unconnected. ""When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win theNew York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...e could not fathom why illary wanted to run now...""[Branch, 557]➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because ""of hardintelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins."" [Branch, 594] My Life discussesthe cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.DI 'Gephardt is an asshole,"" illary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. Shewinced but shrugged with a smile. ""Well, he is,"" she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the firstlady's epithet."" [Branch, 263]"

3090,3091,398,101,41.0,298,2,1,2,"Counseling That elps the Dying LiveBy Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott,  29, 2009Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in ouselegislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-lifecounseling. ow our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,including invocations of itler and fear-mongering about ""death panels."" As a result of theseattacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congresshave abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service andthe misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerousscans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. er doctors were among thebest in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latestadvances in, pain management.Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of herfamily for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice andtreatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington ome and Community ospices. Theiringenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in herfinal months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brookeanticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions andexercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fullyinto the hands of Washington ome as an outpatient. gular house calls by hospice doctors,nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time withfriends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. owever, controllingthe cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the currentnational debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke's treatment in the last stages of herillness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case withBrooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counselinghelped make possible. ospice care more than meets the standard of the ippocratic oath: It notonly does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. Ifcounseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform,many Americans will be as well.Devin Talbott, along with his brother Adrian, is co-founder of GenerationEngage.

Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to theUSA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment wasintended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.is colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) and ranking publican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.""I would just point to the actual language in here,"" Klobuchar said, ""which is, it's not like this is some pie-in-the-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says,"" she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that therehave to be ""reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized nationalsecurity investigation,"" and you can't investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there's gotto be some suspected foreign agent involved.""So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard,"" she concluded. ""There is a standard inplace here.""""That's the standard that is in the bill now?"" Sessions asked.Klobuchar nodded that it was.No it's not, Durbin interrupted. ""Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment,"" not the bill, he said -- ""and Ithink it's critically important that you understand what we're establishing here.""Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway.Blame the gatekeeperThe usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day ofwork and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heedtheir expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.)Then, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is ""notaessible"" to senior career folks, that she's overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised ""opendoor"" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days, that'sCheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State illary Rodham Clinton.We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff,counselor, overseer of aiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) --has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.Not so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department's top career official. ""This secretary is intouch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making thathappen.""Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in  and Africa in  andIreland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she'll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving.There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.ey, just telling you what we're hearing.In a timely fashion ...The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureau,in an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette,Ind., to ""assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have beenprofessionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatestpossibility of suess in the foreign service.""Well, good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.The rest of the résuméThe White ouse last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie . Roberson, a nuclear expertand senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of theDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.

Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the EnergyDepartment for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's notmentioned in the White ouse release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004.Waterboarding for kids?WGDB, Part II: Sen. m Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen.John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federaldeficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction.""It is deeply personal with me,"" Coburn explained. ""I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see thepotential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going towaterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to floodthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities.

SidFrsOrn The Times 3, 2009I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr CameronA sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. e should beashamedDavid AaronovitchOn  morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On  evening I went to see a play. Theplay was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.In a series of short ""chapters"" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as theoupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on  10, 1941. AsPoland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from twokilometres away; no one survived.In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, butlocal Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne ""in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime"".istory matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the ry-backedgroup in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart, of their political appeal.But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. eopposed it vigorously, associating himself with the ""Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne"". Among itsleading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the President apologised — said: ""These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,so why should we apologiSe?""Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, themurders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone ""from theJewish side"" apologised for how ""the Jews"" behaved during the Soviet oupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month MrKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. ""If you are asking the Polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in Jedwabne,"" he said, ""you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewishcommunists did in Eastern Poland.""It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collectiveJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to ""Jewish actions"" and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns ofmassacre denial: ""it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us."" MrKaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. aving read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the lastfew weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: ""Ishould apologise?""But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron hasgot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.Now ry columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt, and to attacking non-existent ""smears"" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.Why?It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. Butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, forexample, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that MrCameron would join if he were a Pole. The new ry grouping, the European Conservatives and formists, by contrast,is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the BritishConservatives.So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that MrKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised hisEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the ""federalist"" EPP, and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.Was it all necessary? as it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,the annanites, the Cashists and the dwoodians?This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want tokeep digging."

It is a very bizarre sense of autism.""Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after DavidCaii.e.con outlined a fresh ry approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Oversocial and employment legislation, the ry leader said.Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate ""bust-up"" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powersnegotiations to last as long as five years.But that position was not enough for the ry MEP Daniel annan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesmanin Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become ""self-governing"".France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: ""It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the resultof a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short."" e said Cameron's approachwas in line with the ries' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of whichSarkozy's UMP party is a member.""They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence inthe European parliament,"" he said.Lellouche said he has told ague personally that his position was a ""waste of time for all of us"".""I have told William ague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all byyour self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us,"" the French minister said.Lellouche made clear the ries had no hope of securing support for their plans. ""It's not going to happen for a minute.Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that,"" he said. ""It is a time of tumultuous waters allaround us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is timewhen the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fightingit out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.""We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're bigor small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance."" e explained: ""Finally we haveinstitutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate"".In a sign of France's determination to resist the ry plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the Frenchwould attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.e pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.""If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think therelationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is ofcourse finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. Thatshould tell you quite a bit huh?"" he said.Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for ry relations with the rest of Europe although in the shortterm he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provokecries, of betrayal on his backbenches.ague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of theries' plans in Europe.""That is not how we are seen across Europe,"" he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relationswith Sarkozy's party.""1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals,"" he added."

3153,3154,539,0,15.0,248,2,1,2,"I've attached the gorgeous cover as a PDFillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the WorldBy Joe KleinTime Magazine, Nov. 04, 2009It was alloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to startpeace talks immediately,"" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State illaryClinton standing at his side, poker-faced. ""I think we should ... get on it and get with it.""It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and theirleader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the WestBank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering apartial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This wasa nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an ""unprecedented"" offer,Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama hadsoftened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli""restraint"" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing thatNetanyahu's proposal was, indeed, ""unprecedented,"" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The mostimportant thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on thePalestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arabneighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan ""falls far short"" ofU.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it ""unprecedented,"" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish onNetanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talkswithout preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clintonhad violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of formerSecretary of State Madeleine Albright.)Clinton's Three QualitiesFor the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You goto Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there ""guardedly optimistic"" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but theIsraelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. Thebreakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go toJerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo andreach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to theNational Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors havedistinguished themselves. enry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, wasRichard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the agan Administration; JamesBaker had clout because he was George .W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others havebeen frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is illary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American inthe world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walkingheadline. er very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. Theconventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby sueeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton'sreticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard olbrooke doing theheavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if shebecomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as theObama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrumlooms: ow will Clinton choose to use her power? ow will Obama react if and when she does?Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage thestriped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaignindicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonianidealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalemindicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East aggling 101.There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision ofdepartmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold theoffice since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understandand interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is aninternational celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only tothe President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, althoughher performance so far, at home and abroad, has oasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemedtentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early ,Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seemsfar more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of illary Clinton'scampaign.)Independence and CandorIn the last week of , Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at thebehest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting herindependence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone afteran opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — ""Can't we all just get along?"" — phase.During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have beenunprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by olbrooke and Pakistanspecialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that hadbeen bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""Wesaw her praying there,"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, ""and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans havehearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hostsand Pashturi elders -- and that, on oasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in thePakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Pressaounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton'sundiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having thePakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrastwas especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of PervezMusharraf. ""In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,"" said FarahnazIspahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostileor not, has made a big impression — and because she's illary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, itmeans so much more.""Transformative ExperienceThere are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, andClinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an albumof photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton anddaughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes,"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,talking about the ""reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.""Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, Ibelieve, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; whenwe set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a verypersonal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it wasChelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policyczar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, illarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famouslyridden an elephant; illary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.""That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after herJerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearingglasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I'vedone since,"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton trine: ""Women's rights are humanrights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 yearsof insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outsideBhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwarkameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever didanything like that,"" Clinton says.When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part becauseBhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember askingBhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, ""I used to be ableto walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf.  can't."" When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —""The Saudis,"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, andparticipation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were soinadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education andhealth care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the StateDepartment but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, therewas immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgencymanual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Atone point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potentialDemocratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, ""You mean, aside from illary?""It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and olbrooke (""my two alpha males,"" she calls them) for the first time -at her home in Washington on the  before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for themilitary while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught thanusual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. Infact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White ouse staff.Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAIDdirector, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things,"" says a Clinton adviser, ""like, Farmer hadat one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into aiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but theamount was illegal.""Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, ""I'm a publican. I disagree with herabout practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to thewoman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpestexchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama aused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bushafter she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tonehas been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israelisettlement freeze by claiming, in , that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, notoutposts, not natural-growth exceptions."" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed arhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(ad ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")The White ouse was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White ouse staff is several stepsremoved from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out ofthe room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored thede facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.illary's ChoiceThe tensions between the White ouse and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are insubstantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither iswilling to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growingperception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seemsready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remainrecalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass onhuman rights with no apparent quid pro quos.The White ouse argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it willreturn to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obamareally has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to haverefrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but thisAdministration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happenovernight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a suess, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can beexplained to the public.There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, whichrepresents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, butin his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peacehunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it isaompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that amid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,"" says Leslie. Gelb, author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough, suessful politicians, and they'll begin to takeyou less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her oasional mistakes. er praisefor the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are alsoburblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need forthe Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White ouse is perplexed by theuncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's oasional overseas gaffes.These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication thatthe Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of NewYork, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State.  do that,though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President'sprimary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officialshave spoken on the  talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the  shows once. ""Eitheryou have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,"" says a formerpublican Secretary of State, ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the  shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledgedthat she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, televisionis a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: ow much can these former rivals — both extremelyguarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter egoon foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's apublican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Joneshas settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreignpolicy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioningthe $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""ow much damage controlhave you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton'smeeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know,"" shesaid. ""I hope some.""Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well, this trip was long overdue,"" she said. ""The Pakistanipeople really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the droneattacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about thedamage control"" — she paused, thinking it through — ""I'd have to say a lot. She aomplished a lot.""In the end, though, Clinton's suess will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President whoknows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there."

Sidtittp://www.qpi.corn/n NewsiAnalvsis/2009111104/Corranentary-Wariords-R-UsitiP1-16551?57351379/ornment- Nanot T i suARNAUD DE BORCGRAVEUPI Editor at LargeWASINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are suessful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., theTaliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspireagainst us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghanexperience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at leastnot significantly.The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion timesover the last eight years, replete with terrorist ""trainees"" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggypantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates ofPakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatientmaidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's ""martyrs"" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events inAfghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that'swhere al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in  2001. They moved toPakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstitutedTaliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its nowinsecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribalareas is suessful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives arewidely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/isdoing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitalswill do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincialtowns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites willdo/are doing it.Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefscompound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, whichhas 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida centralissuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of ""no more Sept. lls,"" what are the UnitedStates and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, theTaliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there waspalpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden wasissuing ""too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religiouseducation."" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost powerand his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizenhas seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. efforthas been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among manyothers came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, aFlorida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. Allrequirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEYwas able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chineseammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEYand its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPostreporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are notdisrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul thatreviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban tofight the Afghan government.The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. Theseare the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as themilitary takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq andAfghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, afterauthorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket."

That's more than Vice President JoeBiden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.Aording to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White ouse, with seven in 10 saying theformer Alaska governor and 2008 publican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.The survey indicates that a majority of publicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating sheisn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percentdisagreeing. Aording to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, ""Going Rogue: An American Life.""""The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOPnomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike uckabee,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating olland.Aording to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feelingthe same way about uckabee. Among publicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63percent of GOPers think that Romney and uckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same ofPalin.""Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that shecares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,"" says olland. ""But the perception that she isnot qualified for the White ouse is her biggest Achilles heel.""An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's lownumber may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Bidenpersonally.""In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,"" sayolland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only ifrespondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, headds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as theadministration grew more unpopular. ""Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes towardthe Bush/Cheney administration did,"" he says.illary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,olland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - ""which might explain why somerespondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.""The CNN/Opinion search Corporation poll was conducted  13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned bytelephone.

Itwould be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to moveAfghanistan forward.Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned.I have to meet with Sen. y tom'w, for example. e believes that the women are critical to stability and peace inAfghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of thetalented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcomingministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better ifhe tapped women and so many are highly qualified.Thanks."

Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.A group led by Mr. eyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. e later spunoff GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. Butafter Mr. eyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: ""Thereis a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow.""Mr. eyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including eyman Properties, which owns shoppingmalls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.""e was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did,"" said Leon Black, the chairman ofApollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. eyman's investment banker.Mr. Black added: ""e combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fiercenegotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was hiscompanies, his real estate, his art collection or his family.""Mr. eyman was born  1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus eyman. is father was a real estatedeveloper. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and arvard Law School in 1964, Mr. eyman went to work in the JusticeDepartment under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. e had to cutthat career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.Mr. eyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. eyman becamefrustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.Mr. eyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal througha shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were consideredvirtually untouchable.Once Mr. eyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it abig contributor to the company's profit.e also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an ""impatient man. When Isee a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time.""Mr. eyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowshipsto encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. eyman won the President's CitizensAward in 2008.is other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie eyman Center on CorporateGovernance at the Benjamin N.

They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, whereofficials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'withdrawing from consideration amid a White ouse vetting process that Clinton denounced in  as""ridiculous,"" ""a nightmare,"" and ""frustrating beyond words.""$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for search,Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budgetof more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaination fund and helping launch the foundation's GlobalDevelopment program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upsetdevelopment experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone whohad already gone through the vetting process.¶ Shah fits that bill and has important political credentials, having worked with or for several leadingDemocratic politicians.il"

Sidas Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?By Andy McSmithLord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on ry leader'slinks with media mogulDavid Cameron has been aused of making a ""contract"" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political supportbefore an election for government favours afterwards if the ries win.The ausation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face ofGordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all thisweek over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit thecommercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the ries isa pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what DavidCameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of ""top slicing"" theBBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regionaltelevision companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectivelyagainst Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.When the policy was abandoned in , Jeremy unt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was becauseenacting it might make the commercial television companies ""focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies"".There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the ries will freeze thelicence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeingany government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company, Sky. ""Thiswas done for News International,"" a ry insider said yesterday. ""Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.e doesn't want the independent companies strengthened.""In  2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after takingover as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that aConservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.Last summer James Murdoch attacked the ""abysmal record"" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over seethe BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its ""total failure"" to stop the BBC buying the LonelyPlanet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an ""egregious"" invasion of private enterprise by the state.Less than two months later, Jeremy unt promised that the ries would abolish the Trust.In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that ""nocommercial competitor can afford"". e had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,promised that a ry government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had ""effectively formed a contract, overthe head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another"".Speaking to the BBC's day programme, he added: ""What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election isone part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is theother side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followedup by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.""This was ""absolutely, categorically"" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, m Newton Dunn, who aused LordMandelson of talking ""preposterous nonsense"".The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under ny Blair's leadership, announced that it wasjumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in .Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressiveattack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan ""It was The Sun wot won it"".But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, hasadmitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by amakeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.A poll yesterday for the website Politicsome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman LordAshcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was ""inappropriate"" compared with 23 percent who thought it was ""legitimate"".The closeness of the new ry-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameronpersonally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his""cast-iron"" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper hascampaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of TheSun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.is announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail, but in TheSun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline ""Cameron's crusade for UK rights"".The person behind this aggressively pro-ry policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sunvirtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he ""regretted"" hisson's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, ""who is a friend of mine"", but defended it on the grounds that Brown hasbeen a ""disappointment"".Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leavingthe Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. isreplacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the ries.m Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. is father, Bill, used to be ary MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.Independent News and Media Limited"

Also for the first time, Ohio votersdisapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval  7.In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, thePresident or Congressional publicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University surveyfinds. In a  16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In , they approved of his handling of the economy48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.""The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in theGovernor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in themost important swing state in the country,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac UniversityPolling Institute.""Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they noware split whether he or the publicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a veryworrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most ofAmerica.""Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall jobObama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.""In , when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls,"" said Brown.Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In thebattle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percentundecided. Portman leads car dealer m Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.""None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats werewinning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio.

Its author is a right-wingpublican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for uman Events. I disagree with the ideological andpartisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather thanthe administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is noreason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern ofthe past is that the deficit, the talisman of oover publicans, moves only partisan publicans and that Democratsascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universalimpact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VAdon't show up in the email but they are described. Sidturn to the Article 13, 2009Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?By Sean TrendeJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set inVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals toupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, ifimitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner'scoalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarilysuessful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the electionof the most liberal President in American istory last year.Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come inVirginia. publican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (thoughnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire publican ticket won by similar margins, and theGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assemblyraces by fewer than 1,000 votes.There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand istoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weaknessamong Independents was simply a function of more publicans calling themselves independents but retaining theirpublican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that publicans' low self-identification is a salient factor inelections.But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots ofthe mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democraticcoalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They beganbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks andliberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred amoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a publican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used acombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovationfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of thepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win byeight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you callsomeone ""macaca,"" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,and are fans of ""law and order."" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a cleanenvironment. aving to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balancedbudgets are the ultimate ""good government"" indicator for these voters.Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economicgrowth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the ""Carter"" label for the Democrats. This,in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even moreheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have puttogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left thestage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obamareceived 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among theremaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced withvanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals wereenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first blackPresident.But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of theparty gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out thedoor, the party isn't left with much.We see a microcosm of this story in last 's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look atthe counties that Mark Warner won.The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's.  oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in themining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whitesin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,but it worked.Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That areabecomes solidly publican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved induring the 1920s.As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other thanObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that theJacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — atleast on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginiachanged from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the publicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved towardDemocrats.We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DCsuburbs in the northeast, the ampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of amptonRoads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in2004 and McDonnell's 59% on . Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop theticket, rural Virginia went solidly publican.We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let'scompare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at ""relative movement."" Becauseeverything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing ""movement"" would be solid dark red, and not ofmuch use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it movedless than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven'tmoved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southernportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). Thissuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was sodramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at ""relative"" shifts.The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving publicansaround 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for publican growth (and remember, ""blue"" in a relative map stillmeans slight movement toward the publican since 2008)! The real publican gains over the past year have come inthe DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the ampton Roads area.In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able towin without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of theClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there isvery, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, tomake an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trilliondollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decademake suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for atsome point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their firstyear, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise toenact a net spending cut any more.Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when themood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this outwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the deathpenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18points, even holding everything else equal.The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats inthe ouse of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbsvoted publican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the publican 60% of the vote likeit did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie ddWhitman or m Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term publican Governor since 1969. Conservativepublicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and publicans picked up two City Council seats on theoutskirts of Queens. publicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figuresprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executivethere with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seenhis attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't movedmuch against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor andSenator, in classic ""Emerging Democratic Majority"" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And ofcourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, publican missteps, and a host of otherfactors could keep the band together for them. be some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the pollsto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting toshow its downside for downticket Democrats.The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could findthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.Sean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.Page Printed from:http://www.realclearpolitics.comiarticles/2009111/13/can_the_clinton_coalition_survivethe_age_of_obama_99046.html at  13, 2009 - 08:19:49 AM CST"

Gelb 22, 2009 I 10:50pmThe Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie . Gelb on why the president should shake up hisforeign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip'slimited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top ofthe inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obamashould be clear: e should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role indecision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world'smost dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. e only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralismand mutual understanding. e needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and tradeproblems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticizedObama for not getting China to ""throw its weight around."" What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Otherslamented that Obama couldn't make ""demands"" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, andthat Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,and that China is not now ruling the roost (more aurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obamacontinued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomachthis nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for aommodating China andalienating America's allies.Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect ""deliverables""on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (whenyou consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions tomake on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and aomplishments oncertain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidentswouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during thevisit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned forRichard Nixon by enry Kissinger or for George . W. Bush by James Baker.Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, andthe fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce waysto gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing wouldactually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and NorthKorean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-deserved vacation in awaii.Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. e seems to dothis stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunatethat Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television andmeet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leadersobviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such aess. But heand his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamiceconomic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.The White ouse might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. ButState's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,surely knew better.

If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asiajourney and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as insidecounselors or outside advisers.If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would haveadvised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking theGod of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateralorganizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the AsianDevelopment Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai CooperationOrganization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations areincreasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asiannations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that Chinawon't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't wantWashington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out aleadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified itsleadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations likethe World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in thenew Pacific Era.Leslie .

Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the officialunemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in , when you include discouragedworkers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in , current job losses still average morethan the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.Also, remember: The last recession ended in  2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployedand looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economicnumbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus withanother round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governmentsand provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. elping the unemployed just by extendingunemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now asa way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and aept lower wages.Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobsformally lost.This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, financejobs and manufacturing jobs. cent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to othercountries.Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of jobapplicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions ofunemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a veryhigh level for two years or more.The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and ananemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home andcommercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estatemortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greaterprotectionist,pressures.The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.Roubini is professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and Chairman of RoubiniGlobal Economics.ad more: http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/15/2009-11-15 the worst is yet to come unemployed americans should hunker down for more job lo.html?print=1&paqe=all#ixzz0WwGikNI"

SidFinancial Times FT.comOMMENTeditorialUS fumbling for a new China tonePublished:  16 2009 20:39 I Last updated:  16 2009 20:39Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese oneverything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obligedBarack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just howdependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west andthe relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internalcontradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumblingfor the right one. Take global imbalances.In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is notabandoning kyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business asusual. ""One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on Americanconsumers and Asian exports to drive growth,"" he said.That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publiclysceptical about the US's long-term finances. China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans tospend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay forhealthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federalserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is abit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent ofgross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it canaddress a humbled superpower.Mr Obama's efforts to oupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularlyhis decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.is administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth itschief creditor.illary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not ""interfere"" with matters ofimplicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his kyospeech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indicationthat Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear MrObama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on  — though even that could notundo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's riseneed not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US aommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to commonperception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependentChinese growth has been on the US consumer.Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the sameas Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. e need not — andmust not — kowtow.Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2009. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

3293,3294,1667,0,7.0,277,2,1,2,"Council on Foreign lationsExpert BriefThe U.S.-China Economic lationship: Separating Facts from MythsSteven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow for International EconomicsAuthor:Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Authorof the Council Special port, Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis. 16, 2009http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2FchinaMany myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, andit is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. Thefact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the UnitedStates is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities haveemphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability inChina is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate therebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes inChina. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit inPittsburgh in  2009.Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main ""banker"" for the United StatesChina holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is theUnited States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are otherwilling public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although theU.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in theevent that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on thereason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if Chinareduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greaterflexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance itseconomy and be able to sustain rapid growth.China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China tofinance its budget deficits.If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of officialreserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase itspurchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be anappreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected byChina's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweighthe effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of othermajor currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interestrates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. owever, the U.S.Federal serve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent marketdisruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur asubstantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and arevery unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternativeofficial reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goodsThis is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types ofmanufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitutefor products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition amongproducers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers arenarrowing.Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth inChina is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet thisobjective in 2010 and sueeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. Whileno country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, thereis less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quobecause of past suess and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. cent developments inChina's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since  2008, China has reverted tofixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for ChinaChinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effectson China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changesin China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has beena major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improveconditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment ofmigrant workers). ence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability inChina also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although Chinaaounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products fromother countries given China's large trade and current aount surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodityproducers may be benefiting from China's strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the worldeconomy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chineseauthorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing theChinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy, but this should be done in his private discussionswith China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much moreeffective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other majoreconomies.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the bestinterest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth towardgreater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting Chinato fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the UnitedStates and other major economies."

Do we need to kill it to save it?BY MATTEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State illary Clinton, the troublesof public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a widerange of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world haschanged, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The mostpressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report afterreport, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable torespond to the new 21st-century paradigm.But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great umpty Dumpty andreassign the pieces?There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its ""core missions"" oftraditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Aountability Office (gao) foundthat the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (abureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including""today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,"" the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like theInternational Atomic Energy Agency.Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within theAfrica bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadershipin operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computerscapable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies onPentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Departmentnow performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, forexample, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the StateDepartment's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy andpublic affairs.Further, rivalries between the different ""cones"" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the ""conal caste system""-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureaunoted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a ""failed office"" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership ""does not understand public diplomacy."" The sentiment iswidespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professionaldiscrimination against those in the career track.Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in humanand financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering itsbottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. MikeMullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation isso dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. Ifthere were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would meanit would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to suchluminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the ""expandingrole of the military in U.S. foreign policy."" e said he was concerned by the ""migration of functions and authorities fromU.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense.""Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroyit. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as publicdiplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and theU.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of onehidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This ""Department of Stateand Non-State"" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering andupholding alliances with foreign ministers.  transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigidhierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrowauthorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countriesand more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured tooversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, theregional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This wouldhelp eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the DefenseDepartment (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regionalleaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. Thesechanges would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path fortoday's requirements.But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by abureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growingpower would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and moreimportantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at suess.In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for theState Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eightyears as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeedcannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading andimplementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. TheUnited States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a presidentwhose entire election platform was built around the word ""change,"" and an American public that would be outraged atthe dysfunction if it only knew the details.3"

BLOWA hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened ""A Tale of Two Cities"" with the now-famous phrase:""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ...""Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks inAmerica. So far, it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the firstblack president with the cultural capital that arues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racialtensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst foran era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria ofhope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they'vegotten worse.The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.A  report from the Pew search Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-pricedsubprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced ispanics as the group withthe lowest homeownership rates.Aording to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rateover that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,the rate grew by about twice that much.And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, ""food insecurity"" forAmerican households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience thatfood insecurity.Things on the racial front are just as bad.We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaustomed. Any protesterwith a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, raciallyoffensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the resultsof image searches of them.And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. Aording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hatecrimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which wouldinclude Obarna's ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against theother racial groups have fallen 19 percent.This has had a sobering effect on blacks. Aording to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent ofblacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half thatpercentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect amongblacks. Aording to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites has droppedto 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.Also, this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up foraidentally shooting off a gun in a club. enry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off hismouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beatRihanna. Former presentative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the ""personal failings"" ofTiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically alaimed black movie of the year,""Precious,"" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the presidentfeels like a nice counterbalance.owever, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama'senemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when theirvoices would have presumably held greater sway.This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important toAfrican-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. Inthe Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting effortsto aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.Aording to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obamawould still be president.  a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more ableto aept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his ""trueessence."" In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result?

3402,3403,1703,0,7.0,385,3,1,3,"Krugman, in case you haven't seen: 1, 2010Op-Ed ColumnistChinese New YearBy PAUL KRUGMANIt's the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics:I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows amercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly,predatory.ere's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged byofficial policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantageover its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency,unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not outof it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.This policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But whatabout the rest of us?In the past, China's aumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguablydoing us a favor by keeping interest rates low — although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate ahousing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest ratesare close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end someday. China's bond purchases make little or no difference.Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S.employment by around 1.4 million jobs.The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. cently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints:""On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionistmeasures."" Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let itscurrency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.First, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy bydumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses onthemselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also meanthat China has little or no financial leverage.Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think itwould significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that wouldbe good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them athank-you note."

3424,3425,866,0,16.0,387,3,1,3,"Cover story in the Economist this week. Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea. Korean parliamentarians want toget women and economic growth on the G20 agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japanto advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year.On another note, so sad about Smith Bagley. e was a good person and was one of your biggest fans.Women and workWe did it!Dec 30th 2009 The Economist print editionThe rich world's quiet revolution: women aregradually taking over the workplaceGetty ImagesAT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate:within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become themajority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority ofuniversity graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professionalworkers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run manyof the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.Women's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of ourtimes. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menialjobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected toabandon their careers when they married and had children. day they arerunning some of the organisations that once treated them as second-classcitizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try toresist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and somesouthern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talentand frustrated citizens.This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet eventhe most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particularadvance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largestcompanies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paidsignificantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work andchild-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they havetoo little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children—particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels offemale participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public moneyon child care.Dealing with the juggleThese two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choosebetween their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressurecompanies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and thenfind it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled womenare trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost asmuch as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relativepoverty also disadvantages their children.Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even ifsome of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superiorworkers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,including the ""war for talent"" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Lawfirms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their ""up or out"" promotion systemsbecause they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies inGermany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making iteasier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In theEuropean Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. InAmerica three out of four people thrown out of work since the ""mancession""began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.The light hand of the stateAll this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stoppedcalls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has usedthreats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there arewomen. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer ofthe social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,there is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of manyworking women and their children?If that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-actionprogrammes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer isno.  begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal andunfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthyperiods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helpsexplain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has alower proportion of women in management than America does.But there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make lifeeasier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed athome. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charterschools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, withoutgoing to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: itspends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other richcountry, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paidmaternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoricabout ""real family values"".Still, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress thatwomen have made in recent decades. During the second world war, whenAmerica's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up theimage of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and ""We Can Do It"" slogan, toencourage women into the workforce. day women are marching into theworkplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remainingglass ceilings."

In pursuit of its narrow and evencrude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Itswillful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in abeggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generallyare the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but alsoelsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strikedown the responsibilities of internationalism.Internally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be themost unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime ishardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers orex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which aounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear ofoperating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with realchoice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes ofentrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is aompanied by expandingarrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on recklesseconomic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no ""soft power"", not justbecause of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forcesits way through coercion of one sort or another.The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at arhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase ""strategic reassurance"" was risibleand did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vaticanto the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States mayeven have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutionalamendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the firstfemale one will not be so great.Sidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton, and an Oscar and Emmy award-winning documentaryproducer. e is writing a book on Abraham LincolnAlso by Sidney Blumenthal:""The choice"" (21  2007)"

3468,3469,1728,156,97.0,372,3,1,3,"I. IntroductionThe next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership inbridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special presentative for GlobalIntergovernmental Affairs (""S/SRGIA""), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of theDepartment and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working incollaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on theSecretary's and Administration's priorities.II. Key ObjectivesThe Special presentative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the globalneeds of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA willalso connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, andfacilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent withDepartment priorities.III. Next StepsThis work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow andimplement in the next six months.  place the Work Plan in context, we describe belowS/SRGIA' s work-planning process.A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has aountability to serve theneeds of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, ors, local elected leaders, the entitiesthat represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priorityactivities will be as follows:1Sensitive But Unclassified• Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries;• Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and localrepresentatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role;• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the StateDepartment, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage theState Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climatechange, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public PrivatePartnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted gionalBureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, ors, local elected officials, andthe entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreignintergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further theirglobal goals.B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs ofU.S. intergovernmental officials.State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies arecompeting in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards oftheir states' economic suess, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents bothchallenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continuedcompetitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreachactivities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and internationalorganizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but arenot limited to the following:• National Governors Association;• National Lt. Governors Association;• U.S. Conference of ors;• National League of Cities;• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;• National Association of States Attorney Generals;• National State Legislatures; and• Councils of State Governments.Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreachobjective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the StateDepartment efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers andpolicy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups andpublic agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local electedofficials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.territories. Specific objectives are to:2Sensitive But Unclassified• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunitiesfor collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Departmentpriorities;• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships withprincipals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;• Create dialogue with the Governors and ors in preparation for the NGA and orsWashington conferences in the fall;• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroadrequired to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda;• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum ofUnderstandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsibleparties; and• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local governmentleaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration'sNational Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,etc.).C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs ofmiddle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign anddomestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with theobjective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau'sauthorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under theauspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is theInternational Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreigngovernment officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around theUS political system and culture.  date, the bureau estimates the same number ofgovernment visitors in FY10.Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities inpartnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve localgovernmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:• United Cities and Local Governments;• Metropolis;• The World Urban Forum;• UN-ABITAT;• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of ousing and Urbanization;• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;• The World ors Council on Climate Change;3Sensitive But Unclassified• Sister Cities International;• Local Governments for Sustainability; and• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.Priority activities will be as follows:• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreachwith strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middleand senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of whatforeign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their UScounterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,opportunities, programs and connections.D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in thegovernment below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks toimplement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpartcapacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus andoffices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity ofintergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars ofUSAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractorsand have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner withexisting offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, aountability for theoutcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here inthe US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derivedfrom studying suessful and less-suessful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIAwill work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activitieswill be as follows:• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicatedresources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environmentneeded to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and localleaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National CapacityDevelopment Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals forinstitutional capacity development going forward;• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacitybuilding is critical to the suess of our diplomacy and development efforts;4Sensitive But Unclassified• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacitydevelopment by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-privatepartnerships;• Prioritize discrete initiatives to ""fast track"", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility andtranslate priorities into actionable interventions;• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related toglobal intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIAcapacity building initiative; and• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on theirprojects and Department priorities.IV. Administrative Activities• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,consular affairs, etc.; and• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development officewebsites.V. Budget and StaffingS/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.VI. Assessment of ProgressThe short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their globalconcerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level StateDepartment engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new officewill be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and localgovernments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and forparticipation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope toachieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect towork with our gional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess thecurrent state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to thisconstituency.In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassiesand missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies toexpand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in thelong term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officialsabroad. We also seek aountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provideleadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to addressregional State Department priorities.5Sensitive But UnclassifiedIn addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USGprograms, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead insynchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will beanother long term goal for the office.VII. Potential EventsA. Potential Events and Activities for S1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban ors;2.

3481,3482,1729,0,0.0,287,2,1,2,"Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:day, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permitsand new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that willfinally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arabworld would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning anda new future for our children and for their children.Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with thePalestinians.During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climatein which political negotiations would have the best chance to sueed.We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridgeand removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the securityenvironment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existingsettlements.I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,who live in Judea and Samaria.That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normallife over the time period of the suspension.Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizenswill also be provided during this time.garding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in oursovereign capital.As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for allthe city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike.When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation toconstruction.I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peaceprocess forward. There is no more time to waste.Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same."

The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an ""operational aord"" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth thatcan get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty ishammered out in 2010.Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.""We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,""said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.""At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.""Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and howmuch funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United Statespledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of howthey will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.On , China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuseto set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports fromcountries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming."

It's really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained atGuantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U.S. a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most ofthe world (although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. ribiong re this was a goodmove right after Alcy upset the Palauans (as you feared) in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately. Jeff2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning FamilyBy Del Quentin WilberWashington Post Staff Writer,  28, 2009Bahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that thePacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.It should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to thesurprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. e wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he canlook after his older brother, a fellow detainee.The brothers' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context ofGuantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet aJan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficultiesfacing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in theUnited States.The brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies ofthe United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the UnitedStates launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Since at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.Five went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in . At one point, U.S. officials were consideringthe possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Mostcountries have been reluctant to aept Uighurs and risk angering China.In recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to aept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, aording to the JusticeDepartment.The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developedmental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said hisattorney, Elizabeth Gilson. make matters worse, aording to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he wentsearching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.""This is just very difficult and sad,"" said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006who considers himself a friend of both brothers.""Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother,"" Qasim said through an interpreter. ""is brother is only therebecause of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them.""Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, aording to one of their attorneys, SusanBaker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.The earliest they could leave would be , the Justice Department says.Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined tocomment or did not return phone messages.In 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a smallhouse in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers werenot particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship andensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyarsold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quicklyran out of money and couldn't find work. e was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told himabout a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted ""to fight against the Chinese government.""""If I went,"" he told military officials, ""I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan.""There, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The groupbuilt houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and othercalisthenics, records show.Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. is mother was very worried andtold Arkin to find his brother. ""e left because he was a dutiful son,"" Gilson said.After the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar's camp,sending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,where they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.Meanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turnedover the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.In 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at thetime that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The ausations laterdissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreterworking for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in aninterrogation room.When they saw each other, they hugged and wept. ""It was just so emotional,"" Abbas said. ""These brothers fromacross the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time.""In 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. e had a record of disciplinary infractions and had beendisrespectful to the guards, records show.Not for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he wasgranted a request to be moved to Arkin's camp. ""I missed my brother so much,"" he told military officials.By the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present anyevidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In , ajudge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs areawaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.Last year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video gamesand books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years tocome. ""I know I'll die in here,"" Arkin told Gilson not long ago. ""In China, at least I would have a trial andsentence.""Since taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyarby phone. e had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he consideredfruitless legal victories.Two weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau'sgenerous offer. ""Every day here is an eternity,"" he told Gilson through an interpreter. ""But I have to look out formy brother.""Jeffrey L. Farrow"

We'll have a copy for you as well.Afghan speech belowFOR IMMEDIATE  11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's OfficePhone: 202.224.6221Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Armymarks as prepared for deliveryday we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremistsmotivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocentlives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted thoseterrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriateoasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack ed and TedKaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensurethat Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for alQaeda to terrorize us and the world.The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with theAfghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change instrategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to ""live, eat and traintogether [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each otheraountable....and treat them as equal partners in suess."" The Guidance goes on to say that the suess of the Afghansecurity forces ""is our goal."" achieve that goal we should increase and aelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their effortsto become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combatforces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the AfghanArmy and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police thanpresently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Talibanfighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan peoplehate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highlymotivated and its troops are proven fighters.Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need toregain the initiative and create a momentum towards suess. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about theperception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure thatAfghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There areapproximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by  of2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us haveurged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister ofDefense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government areprepared to aept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible andessential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of elmandprovince we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander inelmand province told the New York Times in  that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? Aording to Afghan Defense MinisterWardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to trainAfghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. e indicated he would make an assessment of what wouldbe necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with muchgreater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forcesthey have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts tograduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense MinisterWardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained inthe most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new groupof officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the availableinfrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significantamount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment toequip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and createmomentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is callingit one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to theAfghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be thatkind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of theAfghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we nowface there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap incapabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by aelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by ayear, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses amajor problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemiescan seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate aMuslim nation.Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers ofyoung Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn inpart by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creatinghorrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sidesand became a positive force.That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivatedlargely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. Theybelieve an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could sueed, if they are offered security forthemselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to aomplish the same result as wasachieved in Iraq. ere is what General McChrystal said on  28th:""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see aredeeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismaticleadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would callmid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no planyet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken toinvolve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can aomplish this crucial job, but first we and ourAfghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be takeninto aount as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village inelmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred orso men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long theUnited States should stay, one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then youwill be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.""elping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference ofopinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains theinitiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgencyheaded by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers morequickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for there-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan securityforces.Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the suess of a mission that is clearly in our national securityinterest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase inU.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of suess for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run bya Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks onthe United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. groundcombat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year."

The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunchorganised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nationsagainst the appointment.EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech public's last-minuteobjections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and isunderstood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr ague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Ministerhad consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr ague also reminded the diplomatsof Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, aording to one of those attending the lunch last .A claim that Mr ague told the ambassadors that the ries would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a ""declaration of war""by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr ague said that the phrase was ""a bit strong"". Nevertheless, it wasnot disputed that Mr ague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain andBrussels. Diplomats said that there was a ""clear mark of hostility"".""Mr ague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment ofny Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of aountability and legitimacyinvolved in the creation of the position in the first place,"" Mr ague's spokesman said. Mr ague's strident attack on hisfellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.Mr ague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including illary Clinton, theSecretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of Europeanparties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. e aused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party."

They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants thecurrent parades commission abolished because it gives publicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow theparades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bringdown the assembly or collapse the process.Declan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure byBrown's report."

On-site observers have characterized the current atmospherebetween the two parties as ""poisonous.""B6were invited to illsborough yesterday night. owever, theseparties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included inany substantive meetings.Outstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue andsetting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishingof the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restrictingtheir desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying onlocal councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. SinnFein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades andPSNI involvement.In late , the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after thesummer 2010 parading season.B11.4(B)1.4(D)Key points:B5Outcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsingthe current Executive, the Northern Ireland Act provides for seven calendar days for a newExecutive to be formed. Failing that, the Assembly cease to operation and Secretary of StateWoodward is supposed to schedule new elections though he is not required to do so within acertain timeframe.

Please let me know what you think:Statement by the SecretaryOn the storation of Democratic and Constitutional Order In onduras  27, 2009The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in onduras in the wakeof the  28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of onduras from the Organizationof American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in onduras to implement the measures theyagreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Aord, including the formation of a government of unity and nationalreconciliation and the  2 congressional vote on President Zelaya""s restitution. These are vital elements of theTegucigalpa-San Jose Aord, and the onduran people and the international community expect an expeditiousdetermination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.The  29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutionalorder in onduras. The electoral process -- launched well before  28 and involving legitimate candidatesrepresenting parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted underthe stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoralrenewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the onduran constitution, is an inalienableexpression of the sovereign will of the citizens of onduras. We wish the onduran people well as they choose theirnew leaders on , and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for onduras to reestablish thedemocratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in theregion, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Aord as a democratic way forward forthe onduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a uniqueopportunity to promote that vital mission."

Wouldn't hurt tomention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: ""There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy'snetwork against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreignministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy thanshe does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and muchcommuting between Brussels and Britain.""A blog by the author of our column on the European UnionCharlemagne's notebook. Why did Lady Ashton take the EU's foreign policy job?• Jan 26th 2010, 22:04NOT yet , and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief,is getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation,dropped another depth charge against the baroness tonight. is list of complaints against her is long, andI have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it is literallyimpossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because sheallegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cellstaffed by officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laidon the fact that she has not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see anyconfidential papers. As a former British cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tellsme the British at least may share just the odd secret with her.A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton's post would currently bestruggling with teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by theLisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not alifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men insuits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy forher complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he saysthat it suits the Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton ""sabotage"" the post. My impression is thataritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc a lot of sunnort riaht now and worries she is not gettingenough support, but at the same time worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefingsand advice from British officials, she will be seen as a British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort offear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but it is real enough.Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told byother people.But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming fromofficials close to Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I canconfirm from my own conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking thesame question: why did she take this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key aspossible? That is a dangerous question mark to have hanging over you."

I was in the roomAs recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall aount of how talks faded00 Mark cvnaso c...q,uk,  22  2009 19.54 GMTCopenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lostamid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliatedBarack Obama, and insisted on an awful ""dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. ow do I knowthis? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal madeIt look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movementsand environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was ""the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately andfairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility"", said Christian Aid. ""Rich countries have bullied developing nations,""fumed Friends of the Earth International.All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, madethe mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegatesaying ""no"", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, whodenounced the Copenhagen aord as ""a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominanceof a few countries"".Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation ofhaving to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and thenleft its proxies to savage it in public.ere's what actually went on late last  night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head ofstate was also present for most of the time.What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snubwas obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerfulheads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his ""superiors"".Shifting the blame those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insistedthat industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. ""Why can't we evenmention our own targets?"" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyedenough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should richcountries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threwup her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama wouldget the blame for the Copenhagen aord's lack of ambition.China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in globalemissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting thatemissions should peak ""as soon as possible"". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No oneelse, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese notbeen in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corkspopping in every corner of the world.Strong positionSo how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't needa deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: ""The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans."" Onthe other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon ofMexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more thananyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table forthe first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climateregulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chineseindustry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their onlyopportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, asdid the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developingcountries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-opting the language of equity (""equal rights to the atmosphere"") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftishcampaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted onremoving the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from risingseas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. ""ow can youask my country to go extinct?"" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the numberstayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.China's gameAll this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spenthours in heads of state meetings, ""not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take onbinding targets?"" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wantsto weaken the climate regulation regime now ""in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in afew years' time"".This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. ButChina's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it isbecoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter thismagic formula unless they absolutely have to.Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. Thisis fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not onlynot a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen moredespondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave ofoptimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.[Go]"

During the meeting, in a formal demarche, sung to the tune of TwelveDays of Christmas, the Secretary outlined her aspirations for the new year. They include, and feel free to humalong: open and aountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment ofwomen, fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the UnitedStates Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation,and lastly, a championship for the Boston d Sox.

3714,3715,1837,0,0.0,398,3,1,3,"ere's the update, pieced together from various sources:Starting at around 3 pm , Adams and McGuinness returned to illsborogh to meet with Robinson and ArleneFoster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussioncontinued until around 1 am when the parties left illsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. errelationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talksare. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to pushon today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide towind up today and resume on .Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically withinthe DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised toomuch. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has alsomoved.The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader NigalDodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades frameworkrequires consultation, legislation, and implementation.The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irishlanguage act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with."

3786,3787,1875,0,2.0,400,3,1,3," rebuild aiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped laborrapidly and instill national pride and confidence.By Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire 31, 2010aiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake thismonth. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. ow about startingwith a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of aitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entitymakes a lot of sense.aiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% ofthe population.Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopmentand aentuate political instability.Although aiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western emisphere, aitian youth are a wellspringof creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they arestifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.Fortunately, aiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the aitian Constitutioncommits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many aitian andinternational organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields andproviding services in aiti's countryside.At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were outof work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring theirand their country's pride and dignity.A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the nextcrisis. undreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facingmonumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapiddisbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferringcapital.Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the aitian economy and stimulate recovery from thebottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote directmonetary transfers to beneficiaries. aitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalisticprograms that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumventunnecessary administrative costs.Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in aitian public institutions. During pastdecades, the state provided relatively few services to aitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, stateentities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap.A civic service corps -- wearing the aitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating thegovernment's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It wouldbe a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. aiti is situated in the path ofhurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women-- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate theconsequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensivetraining in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health.An initial step to getting aiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on aiti,including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for . Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluableexperiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in aiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmentalorganization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited andtrained hundreds of aitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in aiti's slums. Thisprogram could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years.The aitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from thepresident's office and the Interior Ministry.And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essentialskills.aiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to aiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scaleway to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes.Robert Muggah, based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, is a principal ofthe SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on aiti's recovery. Robert Maguire ison the faculty of Trinity Washington University and chairs the aiti Working Group of the United States Institute ofPeace in Washington.Copyright (c) 2010, The Los Angeles Times"

The policy review scheduled for  2010 maywell precipitate it. pl26  2009 in Afahanistan, gpvernment, Policy, Pali .s perm.aiin4cCivilian, military planners have different views on newapproach to AfghanistanBy Rajiv ChandrasekaranWashington Post Staff Writer,  26, 2009; A01Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen.Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal's request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president toldMcChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more thanhalf that number by next .Ten days after Obama's speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing thecombined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal's goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.""It's an open issue,"" a senior Pentagon official said last week.Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away withdiffering views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, aording to more than a dozen senioradministration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity todiscuss internal deliberations.Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in  2011 andwhether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his  assessment of the war.The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the Whiteouse and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the  2011 dateby seeking to aelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White ouse, a senior administrationofficial said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Departmentactivities in Afghanistan to prevent ""overreaching.""The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by thesenior administration official as limiting military operations ""in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve twogoals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government."" The use of resource-intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed tobe restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.""The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,"" Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. ""This is not 'go out and oupy the whole country.' ""Setting limitsDuring a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the Whiteouse Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer toAfghan security forces by  2011, aording to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.Obama's essential instruction was, aording to one of the officials, ""Don't bite off more than you can chew.""White ouse officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-stylecounterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome inAfghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White ouse'sdesired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in theadministration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagonstrategists and McChrystal's advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White ouse desire for a lessextensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has cometo be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removingtroops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But theapproach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life bytrying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and traininglocal security forces.McChrystal's plan, the senior Pentagon official said, ""is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas peopleare trying to spin.""Dissent over drawdownDuring strategy discussions at the White ouse, differences between the White ouse and the military came into sharprelief over °baffle's decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in  2011.McChrystal argued against it, aording to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. CentralCommand, Gen. David . Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama tomake the drawdoWn ""conditions-based.""""There was a lot of push back"" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one thatresonated with Obama and Biden.Cartwright effectively endorsed the  2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limitedcounterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, ""but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzaigovernment, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which isnot prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this.""It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation thatMcChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Departmentpaperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployedby the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.""Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president's intervention was to say, 'Okay, if we're starting in of '09, then we're really talking about  of '11,"" said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the  2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawalswould be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thoroughreview of progress in a year's time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal's request to increase the Afghan securityforces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explainthe specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" the after the speech, said that perhaps only ""some handful or some small number"" would be withdrawn. Biden, duringhis MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be ""comingdown as rapidly over the next two years.""The ambiguity over the meaning of the  2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. ""Is thesurge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?"" asked a seniorDemocratic staff member in Congress. ""Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows.""One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers ""don't know if this is all over in 18 months, orwhether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes.""""Until they tell us otherwise,"" the officer said, ""we're operating as if the latter is the policy.""A 'dramatic change'?Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had beencircumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White ousehas embraced McChrystal's original plan.""We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn't try to clear and hold things more than we needed to,"" said a seniorcommander involved in the war. ""It wasn't a dramatic change by any means.""White ouse officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed aslide stating that his mission was to ""Defeat the Taliban,"" which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because itsuggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission wasredefined to avoid the term.But to military officers, defeat ""doesn't mean wipe everyone out,"" the commander said. ""It means after Waterloo,Napoleon still had an army but he wasn't going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat.""Even before the White ouse review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country's nearly 400 districts.""They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus,"" a seniormilitary official said.White ouse advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed overthe summer.""There was a real narrowing here,"" the senior administration official said. ""Stan has a big leadership task to adapt hisoriginal concept to the new strategic guidance.""The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. ""This doesn't turnaround with a speech,"" the official said. ""But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that ourgoal is 400,000"" Afghan security forces.The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next18 months in aordance with the new goal.""The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever,"" the second official said. ""Thehardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough.""For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White ouse advisers.""Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country,"" the senior Pentagon official said. ""We'veseparated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy.It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them.""Terms such as ""winning"" and ""victory"" have been eschewed by the White ouse. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term ""victory"" when fighting ""anon-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda.""But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama's speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that ""weare in this thing to win."""" a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win,"" the Pentagon official said.""We need to be able to articulate winning."""

3897,3898,1277,0,14.0,368,3,1,3,"Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:By Michael PosnerThe Post's Dec. 27 editorial (""defining uman Rights"") on the Obama Administration's human rights anddemocracy policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point:human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complementeach other in the task of making human rights a human reality.President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying togetherfreedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous ""Four Freedoms""speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom. ause Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includesdevelopment in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it alsowalls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -including the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives.As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: ""Freedom doesn'tcome in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,"" she said. But experience showsus that where broad-based development ours, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures,and governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliablepolice and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right tospeak freely, to participate in their nation's political process and have aess to basic information aboutgovernment, sustainable development is more likely to our. At the same time, democracies withoutdevelopment do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed topursuing both simultaneously.As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, ""engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purityof indignation."" But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and womenwho worked to advance human rights around the world. suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in whichshe forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse forany regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and toensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the rightapproach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century.###"

Apparentlythere is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he hadno choice.That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. e apparently gave hissupport with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriouslyand don't carry the ALBA countries' water.Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that hadan impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions onPinera's support."

In the meantime I thought you might be interested in the report below (copy attached aswell) which outlines the results to date of our global media outreach initiative.Suessfully Engaging Global MediaAbout the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in aitiExamples of Post Efforts to EUROPE• inforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directlywith over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlightedU.S. assistance to aiti and the cooperation of the US with France, the UN and theinternational community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee,MFA, French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positivecoordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USGin aiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensionsbetween the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obamaadministration in aiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S.commitment to aiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor JamesEarl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide)and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about aiti on  20-22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show,"" BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, andother media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV'spreviously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attentionto inaurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiersfrom delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave aninterview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served inaiti, was interviewed by al  newspaper, resulting in positive stories about U.S.assistance to aiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia, whosepaper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of aiti, and received a commitment torun an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation.AFRICA• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly suessfuloutreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston all to aiti. The ship, withAfrican officers aboard, was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s AfricanPartnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide reliefto aiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistanceto aitians, PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct liveinterviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in excellent media placement in allfour countries.• On  20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview onaiti with 5FM, a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. TheAmbassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africafor sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails andSMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gipsreached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on  21 and recorded aprogram via the Africa gional Media ub with SABC-International TV's ""ndezvousAfrica"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radioprograms on two national stations.• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on  22, all major Angolanmedia gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in aiti, including Radio Nacional de Angolaand the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an editorial  23 that stated: ""We needto believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing whois doing something for the aitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like thisis not aeptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in aiti to have an ideaand quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersedethe positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in aiti.""EAST ASIA-PACIFIC• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's  21 byliner on aiti ran as the lead item on theeditorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, theIndonesian national news agency, and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media.• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in aiti, PASeoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who hadpreviously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Koreanspeaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to aiti aswell as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own activeinvolvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on  22, dedicated to theearthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in three days, with almostall comments supporting U.S. concerns.The EAP gional Media ub in kyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguidin aiti on  25 that included journalists from ong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper,Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency),and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in favorablestories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.NEAR EAST• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not ezbollah-affiliated, with most of its fundingcoming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic andmirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in aiti toAl-Jadid on  20. On   23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minuteson morning news talk-show al-adath to discuss American relief efforts in aiti. The PAOwas able to address many of the ausations carried in the Al-Manar report, including themyriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets.[Post cannot engage directly with ezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designatedas a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]• Moroo: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-edentitled, ""aiti: After terror, the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairlyhostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion todiscuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,aommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediatelyagreed that the piece had been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himselfby saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from ""the Bush years,"" but readilyacknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier ofWashington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which hepromised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L 'Opinion published an articleentitled, ""The massive humanitarian action of the United States,"" based on the articlesprovided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance, bothgovernment and private sector, to aide aiti's earthquake victims.• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in aiti relief efforts has beenlargely negative and inaurate, portraying the U.S. military as oupying aiti. Examplesinclude the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01)under the headlines: ""US Crimes in aiti,"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on aiti,"" and""US Forces Stop umanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10, government-ownedTishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a militaryconquest of aiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations, which is the new methodof colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafa,who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. encourage more balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with-journalists from government-owned and independent Syrian media. Post also extended apersonal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information."
3957,3958,1964,0,22.0,407,3,1,3,"Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying toimplement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We haveorganized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English languagetraining; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chairedby senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report backwithin 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.The New Public DiplomacyJoseph S. Nye2010-02-10CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy wouldwin. In today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with otherorganizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest betweenthe government and protesters after the Iranian elections in  2009, in which the Internet and Twitter playedcrucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China.putation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox ofplenty."" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sellmay, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to Britishgovernments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this aount of Tanzanian President JakayaKikwete's day: ""he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.""Skeptics who treat the term ""public diplomacy"" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simplepropaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relationscampaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environmentfor government policies.The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with threedimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimensionis daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. Thisdimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event,others will rush in to fill it.The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a politicalor advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second ours overweeks, months, and even years.The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals overmany years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and aess tomedia channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called thecrucial ""last three feet"" — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if itcuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat publicdiplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China triedto enhance its soft power by suessfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdownin Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do notalways understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreignpolicy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy ""on steroids,"" staffed by diplomats trained innew media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need tocorrect daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message.The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awarenessand set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in differentcultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are aptto distort what is heard.Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult forgovernments to aomplish, given their central aountability structures.The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call""the new public diplomacy,"" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even directgovernmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about buildingrelationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmentalparties at home and abroad.In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather thancontrolling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, canundercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy fromone-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the harddimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called ""smart power."" For-example, the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, andover-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to suess.Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires anunderstanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If itdegenerates into propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead,it must remain a two-way process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding theminds of others."

But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sittingdown with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reformpossible.Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White ouse aides dozens oftimes to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda inexchange for the White ouse abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceuticalindustry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol ill insiders to pushtheir case. ow they did it--pieced together from news aounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and FederalElection Commission records, White ouse visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is atestament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's healthcare system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok,sies. Among these were several that targeted thepharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providingMedicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren'tjust promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)150.)Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol ill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staffRahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official,investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign managerB6and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for theirunparalleled legislative abilities.Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress alsoplayed key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committeechairman Max Bpuf.-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White ouse andPhRMA.Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member ofCongress who switched party affiliations after publicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching partiesTauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the ouse Committee on Energy &Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. e crafted a bill to provide prescriptiondrug aess to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare wouldnot be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not beallowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking ajob helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of2008 simply titled "".Biliy."" It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about theways of Washington. ""The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiatewith drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work forthe pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year."" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, ""BarackObama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money,"" while the candidate continues his lecture,""Imagine that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how toplay the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing.""Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside fromPhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number oflobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were formeremployees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers includingtwo former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.Aording to data compiled by the Center for sponsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu■ed sums to ....:ongressionalecii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from  to the end of  (4thquarter numbers are still beingtotaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over publicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in anyelection cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for sponsive Politics began tracking industry giving, thatDemocrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol ill, and the new President's intention to reform America'shealth care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.On  5, the White ouse a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table andsee what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist forPhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's ealth Care Plans (AIP) Chairman Karen lgnani, m Donohue of theChamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey.

Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,,,td by this apparent change ofheart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.On  15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened ameeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized laborand health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promotereform efforts, ealthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj.PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went toWhite ouse Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at leastfour times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White ouse, one critical to its strategy to promote healthcare reform. On  11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ,..-v_itting_measures to the White ouse thatwould save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the StateDining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the pressand on the White ouse Web site.The next day, ealthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the healthcare reform process calling for the government to finally ""fix"" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elementsof the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that theycould ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White ouse:The first ourred on  2. White ouse visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industryCEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White ouse Office of ealth Care form. On the same day, the publicly availableschedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committeechairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on  20.In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had aepted $80billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. Aording to newsre_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on 2 were able to win the lower figure.The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the ""donut hole"" in Medicareprescription drug coverage. The ""donut hole"" is a term for the gap in coverage that ours within the Medicare prescriptiondrug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spentand does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percentcoverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the ""donut hole.""In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, wecan make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today."" This ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity also extended to thepharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices throughMedicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grandstatement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the Whiteouse and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.Baucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White ouse.These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and publicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi andOlympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which werereliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet theWhite ouse's announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie for passing health care reform.Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White ouse another visit on  7 and this time met withhm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White ouse visitor logs for thismeeting). In , The uffirytorj. !Dosi',.--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting thatoutlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicareprescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part Dand Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.***While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up theirown versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White ouse was relying on Baucus to produce thefinal product. In the ouse of presentatives, the ouse Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair enry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gottenthe White ouse and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating powerand speedier release of generics to the market. Aording to previous analysis of the measures proposed by thecommittee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreedto by the White ouse, Baucus and PhRMA.The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of theCEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White ouse and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go publicwith the deal to ensure that the White ouse would recognize it and not renege. On  4, the Los Ancg•3les•Firrief-,-:, inan exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White ouse and PhRMA existed andthat, as Tauzin put it, ""The White ouse blessed it."" m amburger wrote in the article, ""For his part, Tauzin said he hadnot only received the White ouse pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not topursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.""The White ouse's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, ""The president encouraged this approach ... ewanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.""Democratic lawmakers were furious. p. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, ""Are industry groupsgoing to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?""***On  7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the ill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed$80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in anadvertising blitz in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending ""...would be a follow-up to the deal thatdrug makers struck in  with Mr. Baucus and the White ouse."" On  16, Baucus released the full text of hisles.j.islation to the public. tThe White ouse, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendmenttargeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largestMedicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to pushfor further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. is target: closing the ""donut hole"" completely.Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMA's perspective increase theircost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unaeptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White ouse and to thepharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, m Carper and Robert Menendez voted withpublicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home toAstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80billion cap.Senate Majority Leader arry id introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on  19. Debate began on Dec.3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced anamendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: ""...as currentlywritten, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there aresignificant safety concerns."" Dorgan's amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support ofreimportation switching to ""no"" votes.On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.***New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform billhad been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator TedKennedy in Massachusetts on  19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be thesenator to provide publicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularlyhealth care reform.in the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for thepharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In , the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut byTauzin, pushedjauzin to_res..i.s., his .post.In an interview with Diane Sawvqf., President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform,""[The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongstsupporters that we just don't know what's going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of backroom deals."""

These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact thatthey happened is not off limits.Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked tohim that if I Twilt.--s,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out ofuniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.In  of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus mightrun for President in 2012. In  2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled ""TheGeneral"" referencing my earlier take.cently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for thecounterinsurgency guru in his piece, ""President ?etraeus7""Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & Worldports ""Washington Whispers"" notes, he is going to be speaking in  2010 at the annual American EnterpriseInstitute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.In  2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card raceagainst Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public justdidn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card publican this month and hisnumbers come out as a mixed bag. e has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other publicans we tested. The problem forhim is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him tohave formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, butif he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.President Obama himself, aording to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeusand respects his approach and thinking.Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might reactto a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather thanclear response. (see above video)At the ""First Draft of istory"" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and theAspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic reviewon Afghanistan responded that he ""would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could.""Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr.j., ""We will salute and execute [thePresident's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.""But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way thatthis intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Partytakeover of the publican political machine.There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable publicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, OlympiaSnowe, Chuck egel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita auser and others will try to rekindle classicpublican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.member that Eisenhower clinched the publican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knewwar would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today couldbe the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus runningfor President -- and that is his running for Vice President.I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White ouse, Bidenhas done the best job of outperforming expectations. e had given President Obama much needed counsel, not alwaystaken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the keyagent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward. e has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in thenuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship withRussia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling.But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.As I look at it now, illary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State wouldbe a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. er franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, butmoving illary closer to the White ouse (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundredfeet closer to the White ouse than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all thekey political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine, Deschle's machine, Kennedy's machine,Edwards' machine, and then the Clintons'.But General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he isweak on national security. The publicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want tocontinue to play politics through fear-mongering.Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a publican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting theGeneral on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.Crazy? Perhaps.But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointingpublican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade presentative Jon untsman, Jr.to serve as US Ambassador to the People's public of China.And get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the shortlist of those considered.-- Steve Clemons publishes the popular political blog, The Washington Note."

Gelb 15, 2010 I 10:48pmI ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup tosave his presidency. Leslie . Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get ridof National Security adviser Jim Jones.The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White ouse has reached a critical point. The president mustchange key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly amatter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with provenrecords of getting things done in Washington and the world. be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama orhis White ouse team. be he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking farbeyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and exceptfor the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. Soit is they who've got to go.It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—andespecially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White ouse team. The refrain of complaints isalways the same:• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not ""begrudge"" WallStreeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple ofweeks ago that such big bonuses were ""shameful.""• Obama doesn't know what's really going on. garding the Middle East, he recently said that ""I think it is absolutely truethat what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some ofthese political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high."" e had to be totally out of itnot to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone knowhow to deal with it. e emerges from a meeting with congressional publican leaders on health-care reform and says heis ""an eternal optimist—when those very same publican leaders just told the press that they don't see any commonground and believe the administration has to ""scrap the bill and start over.""• It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. e calls Afghanistan a ""war of necessity"" and orders more than 30,000new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to seesome of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luceprovided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team.Luce named names in the White ouse, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentiallyeridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious asit was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--amilton Jordan and JodyPowell—moved into critical White ouse positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. Andthey were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the ""them"" versus ""us"" (Washington insiders andbureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.The Chicagoans and others ""guarding"" the president create their own ""us versus them"" world. It's hard to imagine a policyconversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washingtonor policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the presidenton a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.ere are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chiefof staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills anddiscipline to run the White ouse. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and thetime to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the Universityof North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White ouse chief as wellunder Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another formerClinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.place Lawrence Summers, director of the White ouse's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the formerchairman of the Federal serve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to wantout anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. e is the only one now in aposition to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others withproven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and m ill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars inWashington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above allwould help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, aomplished businessman andpolicy head.David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and m Deschle, theformer Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficialresidence at the White ouse, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicagobuddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in makingpolicy.Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearlyenough.Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: e wasn't born for daily jousts with pithypublicans. is job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possiblesuessors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or elene Cooper of The New YorkTimes.Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admiredand respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. e handled those duties with great skill. But bywide alamation inside and outside the White ouse, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirementof this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and preciseplans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, isZbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. e has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—andknows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform theNational Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try formerambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, ginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. Theyhave it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama onstrategy.Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They allpossess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a criticalbonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to sueed them in two orthree years.  lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems asintellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition insensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to makeadjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to sueed in smallas well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would sueed.Leslie .

""Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: itneeds, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... e's got a terrificcabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.""Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his firsttwo years, which culminated in the 1994 publican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral""massacre"" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in , he said: ""I subscribe to that view.""Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was oftendescribed as a ""government-in-exile"" during the years George W. Bush was in the White ouse. e said Mr Obama hadthree options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in aelection defeat in Massachusetts.The second would be to pass a watered down bill with publican support The third would be to abandon the attempt,as Mr Clinton did in 1993.Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reformthrough. ""The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track isviable,"" he said. ""It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.""e painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. ""It sucks,"" he said. Pointing to a strategy ofobstructionism by publican lawmakers, he said: ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with publicans, but,quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. e's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.""The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threateningto turn the US into, ""in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule"", where the opposition automaticallyopposes any serious initiatives.The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage ofProposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. ""And so nothing gets done.""Michael . Fuchs of State(202) 647-1709(cell) B6"

Gelb's call for White ouse Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel tobe reassigned spurred a circle-the-wagons reaction from pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces.Gelb sifts the fallout for clues.When you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it wasthat Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in 'sWashington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It wasseemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuel's limitations as chief). But whether it wasintentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself.ere is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, oflabyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom.be the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a ""traitor"" to the boss.With a headline ""place Rahm,"" I wrote last  that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategicability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where hisconsiderable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd.Several writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for theirremoval. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White ouse staff critiques breaking overWashington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out ofchances to sueed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed.Then came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist.Interesting that the leaker selected Milbank. e's sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city,not just the White ouse. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making theleakers harder to trace.The Milbank headline read: ""Why Obama needs Rahm at the top."" It began: ""Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No,seriously."" Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. ""But,"" he continued, ""sacking Emanuel is thelast thing the president should do.""Then, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. ""Obama'sfirst year fell apart in large part because he didn't follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel isthe only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter.""Then, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicagocrowd except Rahm. ""Obama's problem,"" Milbank continued, ""is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett andRobert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, theybelieve he is a transformational figure who needn't dirty his hands in politics.""So, it was ""their"" fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. ""The presidentwould have been better off heeding Emanuel's counsel,"" but instead ""overruled"" him on several key Rahmrecommendations: not rushing to close Guantanamo and bringing terrorists to U.S. prisons, not trying Khalid SheikhMohammed in New York, and going for a smaller health care bill focused on popular items with publican support. ""Theresult was,"" Milbank wrote, ""as the world now knows, disastrous."" In other words, Mr. Obama could have thrived andsaved himself on key issues had he only listened to Rahm.It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near and dear to him) trying to save himself at the president's expense. This is anincredibly unusual leak, seemingly a chief of staff undermining his own boss, the president. Worse, it details specificadvice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama in the absolute privacy of the Oval Office. Presidents go crazy at such breachesof confidence.Which is why another possibility has to be considered: that Rahm was not the leaker. The leak was so egregious, so anti-Chicago crowd minus Rahm, so devastating to the president, that Emanuel couldn't have been stupid enough to leak astory where he was the sole, surviving hero. member, too, that my piece did not recommend kicking Rahm out of theWhite ouse, just sliding him over into a political adviser job where he could practice small-bite pragmatism. besomeone didn't want Rahm around the White ouse at all, in any position. be the leaker thought the way to get rid ofRahm completely was to brand him as a ""traitor"" to the boss. be the leaker belonged to that contingent of self-mutilating liberal Democrats who have always viewed Rahm as too centrist and pragmatic.Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And of course, Milbank put his own views into his own article. But someone gave himthe specifics, the precious ammunition about Rahm's private advice to Mr. Obama. The story is not over.Leslie .

There were no initialreports of any injuries in the blast.Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were inthe process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after amortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. ""Lives could have beenlost as a result of this bombing,"" he said. ""It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or thecause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debatewith their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.""Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, thefirst PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 last year. is murder came just 48 hours after the al IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks inAntrim. In  police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.On , publican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried outsurveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting theareas in white civilian vans. publican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special connaissance giment.The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because Britishtroops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.Britain heading for hung parliamentGuardian/ICM pollries might not win election outright, suggests new survey• Comments (259)• Buzz up!• Digq it• Julian Glover• quardian.co.uk,  22  2010 18.30 GMT• Article historyThe Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, aording to a Guardian/ICM poll publishedtoday.The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron'sparty.The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing theircampaign against Labour's so-called ""death tax"". Labour leads the ries by eight points as the party with the best policyon care for the elderly.The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point ry lead when thequestion was last asked in  2009.With no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month'sGuardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in  2008.As recently as last  the ries hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that therace is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.Meanwhile Labour's support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last , and slightly above itsaverage for the second part of last year. owever, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown'sPiers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.Labour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. searchbegan last  and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observer,which may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on .Nick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll, which puts the LiberalDemocrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smallerparties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of whatthe ries think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25seats behind the ries in a hung parliament, although any improved ry performance in marginal seats would offsetthat.• /CMsearch interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults by telephone on 19-21  2010.

4078,4079,2036,0,7.0,420,3,1,3,"Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing dealGordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 • enry McDonald• quardian.co.uk,  5  2010 11.42 GMT•Gordon Brown, the DUP leader, Peter Robinson, and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness (I to r) talk to the press after theNorthern Ireland power-sharing deal was announced. Photograph: Julien Behal/PAJustice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland's power-sharing government from 12  in a historicdeal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at illsborough Castle outside Belfast, theprime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was afoundation for lasting peace.The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search forpeace — comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharinggovernment might collapse.It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new planson overseeing parades.Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual co-operation and respect"".The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharingexecutive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, includingthe abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9  before the policing and justice powers aredevolved from London on 12 .Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreementbelongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This isthe last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks,weeks of stalemate.""Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions andsaid the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who havelaunched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The dealwould ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.ferring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president,Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as ""yet another very good "".Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set uplegislation to change the way parades are judged.A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the twogovernments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.The talks, which centred on illsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in thenear 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had aused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the lastthree years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led bythe two parties.The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said thebasis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to aept it. Robinsonemerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlierin the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enoughconcessions.Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. ""Wehave a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in NorthernIreland and to the community.""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; webelieve this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""owever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels hadchanged their minds.""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the dealas a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism."

Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of thesuessful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.ry campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from orBloomberg, who retains close links with the British ry leadership.e was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the publicans when he first ran for mayor.The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to beseeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling andstrategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown.None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.owever, it is the decision of the ries to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that issurprising. Their party usually has looked to publican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retainingclose links.Ms. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter's administration and subsequentlyworking as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White ouse with President Obama but left latelast year when her husband, Robert Bauer, the president's personal attorney, was unveiled as the incoming White ousecounsel.Mr. Knapp made television ads for the Obama campaign, has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leadingrole in or Bloomberg's three election wins.The pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught, with the parties trading blows on allegations ofbullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley.In the latest developments, the prime minister  in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he hadknown about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling, his chancellor of the exchequer.In a remarkably frank interview  with Jeff Randall of Sky News, Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in thesummer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway, No. 10 had ""unleashed the forces of hell.""Mr Brown said on GMTV: ""I was never part of anything to do with this.

The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangibleoutcomes that improve their lives.""ferring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, described today's agreement as""yet another good ."" After reaching an agreement just before midnight on , the parties in the NorthernIreland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9  to devolve policingand justice powers, which will then create a justice ministry on 12  — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout thesenegotiations.Under the agreement, a six-member working group, appointed by Robinson and McGuinness, will formulate a frameworkfor handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems, with the rights of marchers andresidents taken into aount. It will complete its work within three weeks, when the Northern Ireland executive will transferresponsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.An executive working group will be set up, in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists, to improve the way the power-sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrewsagreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish languagespeakers.Ian Paisley Jr, the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder, described the agreement as a ""win forunionism"".Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission, which most unionists regard as biased infavour of nationalists. e added that unionist critics of the deal had ""no alternative except the imposition of joint authorityfrom London and Dublin"".Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, Robinson said: ""There are some who will playpolitics with this agreement, but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormontthat our whole community identifies with and supports.""Jim Allister, the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP, said he was ""relishing the prospect"" of a general election contestwith his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency.""In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondly,their veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodiesare strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of paradingissues.""Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post,"" he said.Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined todestabilise the power-sharing government.e said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now ""two groups of people who were onceterrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge"".But the al IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the aord at illsborough. In thepast seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations acrossNorthern Ireland.publican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policingand justice powers are transferred to Belfast."

Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effortto win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, aordingto aides to Senate Majority Leader id.id spokeswoman gan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. id can force a voteon any nomination by filing cloture.Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimousconsent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.The nominations will remain stalled unless id files cloture.While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than isnormal.""e should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,"" a Democratic aide said. ""They're qualified and theyshould be moving forward.""Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with publicanholds on executive nominees.'We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection tothem -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,"" President Obamasaid  in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.On the Senate floor , id, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy andSenate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped publicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.id, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush frommaking recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the presidentcan make when the Senate is out of session.'What alternatives do we have?"" id said on the floor . ""What alternative do we have?""Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on ""several pending nominees due tounaddressed national security concerns,"" including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for anaerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but hasthreatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.""Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have atransparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,"" the spokesman said. ""The Department of Defense mustrecognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.""Defense Secretary Gates  told ouse lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposalssoon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.""Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but wewill move forward,"" Gates said. ""We have to have new tankers.""In addition to the tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won't build anAlabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device AnalyticalCenter to be set up at the Army's dstone Arsenal.""Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensicand technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,"" thespokesman said. ""e has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.""Also , Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by publican foot-dragging that he was consideringwhether Senate rules should be changed.""There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajorityon almost everything,"" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives publicans 41votes, enough to filibuster on any issue.'What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of thefilibuster and how it's worked,"" Biden said. ""This is not a constitutional requirement.""Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it ""a useful tool. It's legitimate, but from my perspective having servedhere, having been elected seven times, I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure. ...quiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.""by Dan Friedman and Megan Scully"

4136,4137,2065,0,9.0,426,3,1,3,"Soaring cost of healthcare sets a record By Noam N. Levey  4, 2010 Los Angeles TimesSpending was 17.3% of the economy last year. The share paid by the U.S. will soon exceed 50%, a study says.In a stark reminder of growing costs, the government has released a new estimate that healthcare spending grew to arecord 17.3% of the U.S. economy last year, marking the largest one-year jump in its share of the economy since thegovernment started keeping such records half a century ago.The almost $2.5 trillion spent in 2009 was $134 billion more than the previous year, when healthcare consumed 16.2%of the gross domestic product, aording to an annual report by independent actuaries at the federal Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, scheduled for release .The nonpartisan aounting agency also projected that as early as next year, the country could mark another milestoneas government picks up more than half of the nation's total healthcare tab for the first time.The rise in current costs, driven in part by surging spending in Medicare and Medicaid, and the bleak projections for thefuture do not take into aount changes that may come if Democrats revive their healthcare overhaul legislation.The report appears likely to fuel further debate about the health bills now stalled in Congress.In the absence of change, the report raises a grim prospect for the country -- a healthcare system consuming an evergreater and potentially unsustainable share of the economy even as private health coverage lags.Last year, CMS estimated that government spending on healthcare would not overtake private spending until 2016,compared with 2011 or 2012 in the current report.""The health system is hurting, and we are seeing that in these numbers,"" said Karen Davis, president of theCommonwealth Fund, a leading authority on healthcare policy.The report also points up the financial cost of the so-called Great cession and the growing pressure it is putting onstate and local governments.Federal and state spending on Medicaid, the nation's primary health insurance program for low-income Americans,jumped nearly 10% in 2009, aording to the report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot up just over 8%.Obama and many healthcare experts have argued that reshaping the healthcare system will ultimately make it moreefficient, even if overall health spending continues to increase -- a claim publicans dispute.Fueled by new technology, an aging population, rising incomes and other changes, spending on medical care has beenconsuming a larger and larger share of the nation's economy for years, jumping from about 5% of the gross domesticproduct in 1960 to nearly 14% in 2000.But the recession that began in 2007 aelerated that trend, as the economy contracted while healthcare spendingcontinued to increase, aording to CMS.Even now, with the economy slowly recovering, the government expects that the growth of healthcare spending willoutpace the expansion of the economy. By 2020, 1 of every 5 dollars spent in the U.S. is expected to go to healthcare.Some economists believe that this is not necessarily a problem, as the healthcare industry can provide good jobs andimprove both health and productivity.But there is growing concern that as much as a third of the medical care delivered in this country does not help patients.""Are we getting value for the dollar? That is the question,"" said Len Nichols, health policy director at the centrist NewAmerica Foundation. ""If you believe that so much medical care is unnecessary, as I do, then it is criminal that we arespending so much.""Stuart Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative eritage Foundation, said that thenumbers underscore the need for more aggressive action to curb spending.""The only way to do this is to simply spend less,"" Butler said, warning that the health bills being pushed on Capitol ill dothe opposite.CMS officials noted that healthcare spending has been increasing even as the number of Americans without healthinsurance is growing, another sign of problems with the system.""With higher unemployment, people lose their jobs [and] many of them lose their healthcare coverage in the process.And under current law, they don't have much to fall back on,"" said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary.Foster said that the report by his office indicated that two of the main trends driving calls for a health overhaul -- risingcosts and shrinking numbers of people with health coverage -- are essentially the same as they were when thehealthcare debate began last year.""Nothing much has changed in that regard,"" he said.Inefficiency is becoming a particularly acute problem for state and federal governments, which the report shows areincreasingly supporting the nation's healthcare system.alf a century ago, government aounted for just a quarter of all healthcare spending. Now, as the cost of caring forelderly and poor Americans swells, government's share of the total bill is fast becoming greater than that of the privatesector.The trend aelerated in the recession, as Washington spent billions of dollars to help states prop up Medicaid programsbeing strained by the growing ranks of the unemployed and uninsured.The healthcare legislation being debated on Capitol ill could increase the government commitment to healthcare asthe federal government boosts the Medicaid program and provides billions of dollars of subsidies to low- and moderate-income Americans to help them buy insurance.But in a separate report a month ago, CMS actuaries estimated that the Senate healthcare bill would boost totalhealthcare spending by less than 1% over the next decade, in large part because the legislation includes initiatives tomake Medicare more efficient."

4140,4141,2068,0,7.0,337,2,1,2,"EU leaders to debate Blair presidency onsummit sidelinesClimate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of ny Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first presidentEuropean government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first oasion to broach thedivisive subject of ny Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding andhow to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But seniordiplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will getthe plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together forsummits at least four times a year.David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a ""strong voice"" on the global stage, but hiscomments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William ague, who said the debate over the presidency provedthat the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blairpersonally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on theformer prime minister's behalf.""We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,"" said anofficial. ""There is only one candidate.""That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is theonly contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. e emerged this week as the anti-Blair.Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well sueed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewedas a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing themeeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of theCopenhagen conference in .Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik infeldt, the Swedishprime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reachagreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to thedeveloping countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europeshould not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK andthe Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climatechange and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagenunless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, theeastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate changefinancing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidatesfor the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or highrepresentative for foreign and security policy.In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whetherthey reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential postthemselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EUmember states — 19 out of the total 27.Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a smallcountry would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this weekto renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of hisgovernment.Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather thanfocusing on who gets what under Lisbon.Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would beconvened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, JoseManuel Barroso, to put together a new team."

4145,4146,684,0,7.0,295,2,1,2,"sbwhoeor,  29, 2009 1:0S PM: Another memo on backdrop to this week. Sid 28, 2009EditorialDiplomacy 101We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. e appointed a skilledspecial envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israelviolence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.Nine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, andPresident Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may befarther off than ever.Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than onemove down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel'scommitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid no.Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peacetalks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his politicaladvisers — specifically his chief of staff, hm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then startnegotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues andpermits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyondwhat past Israeli governments aepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected thecompromise.Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especiallySaudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israelto fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomaticperformance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absenceof a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk wayforward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable."

Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on  3with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt andJordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas wouldseek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. wouldpresent its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. DeputyEnvoy David ale met with Abbas on  5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference(he would aept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role.

Two administration sources confirmed that themeeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would notdescribe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggeststhat the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates toGen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State illary Clinton on the same page before the president's  speech.Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skepticalnation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps andtimeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. is speech,as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. is challenge is to persuade Americans thatthe war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believethat the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, hewould not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into oppositionfrom Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions onAfghanistan President amid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the thestability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan.

Sid 9,2010The First Lady, her young lover, and a scandalthat could hand power to Sinn FeinDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences ofIris Robinson's infidelityThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy, the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulfBelfast's frail political settlement last night.Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson, head of the Northern Ireland government, broke his silence toinsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. is move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiryinto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party, the DemocraticUnionists (DUP), are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavyemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in thecoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Feinbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting thepeace process in jeopardy.Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife, Iris, who has exited from public life, led to a day-long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.Mr Robinson stands aused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactionswithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old ""toyboy"" lover to set up a business.Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel ""to ask me any questions he or she wishes toask, and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation"".Insisting he had done nothing wrong, Mr Robinson aused the BBC of broadcasting ""smears and innuendo"". Saying thathe did not rule out a defamation action, he declared: ""I am being tried in the court of public opinion.""Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister, said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seekingtalks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandalbroke, but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive thestorm.Mr Robinson, who has been First Minister for 18 months, is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since hewas prepared to follow the v Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure fromalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by aepting a transfer of responsibility for policing fromLondon to Belfast.is reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents inthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to thefamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP foreast Belfast, a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediatelyand stop drawing her salaries.These reflected the fact that, while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival, her behaviour is regardedas inexcusable.She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father, Billy. Before he died, he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. TheBBC programme, Spotlight, revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said shesuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council, where she is analderman.She is said to have obtained £50,000 from two property developers, to be used to set up the business. She is also said tohave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it wasinvestigating.The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Black,a former Methodist minister, who gave the BBC aess to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, a hardline critic of MrRobinson. e said the issues in the programme must be addressed ""with utter transparency and candour"".Ulster Unionist leader Sir g Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation, saying: ""It is clear that IrisRobinson's continuing position as an MP, Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all herpositions with immediate effect.""e added: ""It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party willstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct ofthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against theFirst Minister.""* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.But he said: ""It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing thepolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.""And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deepfreeze, even some may wish to unpick, they would be extremely irresponsible, foolish and would be playing very, verydangerous games.""Speaking to BBC Radio 4's day programme, Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunityto clear his name.But he went on: ""I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening, he is First Minister and the business ofdevolution, the business of the Executive must go on.""I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continuesand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.""

It will rate high in the annals of thehumanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is alsobecoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places arestill largely bereft of international aid.Not through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most ofthe aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.scue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters,all in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparentlyforgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, oronly after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen torisk more lives.But the aitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped,and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.The experience of CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgianmedical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN ""rules of engagement"" apparently stopped them providing security for thedoctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers.Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenousdrips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. ""Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest internationaldeployment since the tsunami in 2004,"" aording to ny Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So theimage of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American viewof aiti.CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first fourfrustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after urricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is todistribute food, because of the likelihood of ""stampedes"".Nor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On thecontrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be ""aggressive"" he meant it. The humanitarianoperation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon.Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which hascost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it isaiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.One, perhaps even two million aitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead aitianrefugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. aiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollarsthat have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth.Even when the earthquake struck, investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds, sentto victims of a hurricane that hit aiti in 2008, that have disappeared.Furthermore, to the horror of many godfearing Americans, voodoo is an officially recognised religion in aiti. And, perhapsabove all, aitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs.The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American militaryinvasion of aiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I'd lived and worked there for almost two years as acorrespondent for Dutch radio. There were 20,000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception theunarmed aitians might have in store for them.It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundantconga lines they snaked through the city, tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. ""Liberte! MerciBeel Cling Dong!"" they shouted. A terrified American GI, still a teenager, saw the mass of pitiful creatures approachinghim, and asked me if the tea cosies were ""some kinda voodoo?"". e calmed down only when a line of BMWs andMitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion.Where the soldier came from, the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In aiti, they are likely to be theones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in aiti are the defenceless people in theslums. For Western city dwellers, this is the world turned upside down. ""Back! Back!"" the soldier shouted, aiming hisweapons at the good guys.The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don't really know what is going on. Seventysurvivors had been pulled from the rubble so far, the International d Cross said on . That's 14 rescues per dayas a joint result of the 1,739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump ifsome of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local peopledesperately digging for victims with their bare hands, day and night.Let's hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Princedropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced thatthey would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without havingguns aimed at them first.Linda Polman's War Games: The Story of War and Aid in Modern Times will be published by Penguin in "

The foreign secretary insisted,however, that.he was ""not available"".Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to becomepresident. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech public will become the last EUcountry to ratify the Lisbon treaty.Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at theElysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, whichbrings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for hispredecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. ""Of course it may not happen and there are othercandidates as well,"" he said.The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders thisafternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in theEuropean parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.Brown told the meeting: ""You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be thepresident of the council.""But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre leftacross the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have towork with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 , saidthe European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. ""There is a preference for the highrepresentative,"" he said. ""That is rather reasonable.""A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had ""dropped Blair"" and that the centre-left in the EUwas seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while thecentre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. ""lt isnot about the person of ny Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have anew treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the nextgeneration between Iraq, Bush and ny Blair.""Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it hadbecome clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to securesuch a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will bepleased by the strength of his suessor's support.Brown said today: ""Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that ny Blair would be an excellentcandidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.""is international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known toeverybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is inBritain's national interest.""guardian.co.uk Guardian News and Media Limited 2009"

4223,4224,0,0,15.0,338,2,1,2,"Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in PakistanNEW YORK TIMES 30, 2009illary Rodham Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrived,extremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nationnewspaper dismissed the visit as a mere ""PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine,beyond the already compliant government.""Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washingtonfor using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington forpressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The factthat many of the extremists are on Pakistan's territory and threatening Pakistan's government has not shifted thatthinking or mitigated that resentment.A good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistan's government, which has still not adequately explained that this isnot just America's fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled thePakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined touse this visit to also broaden the relationship.Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also heldtalks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious collegestudents; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;and visited religious and cultural sights.She promised to refocus American aid on the ""needs of the people"" and announced targeted commitments, including$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricityproject aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aidpackage approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanisthat, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment.The Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabadwas consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civiliancontrol of the military.If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself.And it is going to have to insist that Pakistan's leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the realbenefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clinton's trip was an important start — but only a start."

One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations.""The ry lead of 6%, which was first reported in The  Times, was maintained in YouGov's polls in The Sun lastweek. The increase in support for Labour on  and , as the latest  Times poll was being conducted,came as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery.Under the British parliamentary system, the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tendershis resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote.If the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority, Brown is likely to battle on, with Labour running thecountry as a minority government. The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulster's DemocraticUnionist party or, if necessary, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, to get its legislation through parliament.If repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies, today's poll would leave Labour justnine seats short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the new 650-seat ouse of Commons.The ries would be well behind on 263 seats, with the Liberal Democrats on 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing fora larger swing to the ries in marginal seats, where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning, the poll wasconsistent with Labour being by far the largest party.e suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win 300 seats, with the ries on 270 and the Lib Dems on 50.Labour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy. For the first time in a YouGov poll since  2007,before the financial crisis, people trust Labour more than the ries to run the economy.YouGov, which began polling after the 2001 election, has developed a reputation for auracy. Its final  Times pollin 2005 was precisely right, and it aurately predicted Boris Johnson's victory in the 2008 London mayoral election andthe results of last year's Euro elections.Contact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The  Times, orplace your advertisement.Times Online Services: Dating I Jobs I Property Search I Used Cars I olidays I Births, Marriages, Deaths ISubscriptions E-paperNews International associated websites: MilkroundCopyright 2010 Times Newspapers Ltd.This service is provided on Times Newspapers' standard Terms and Conditions.

Those planning to vote in thespecial election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 pointmargin, in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governorin Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of publicans say they're 'veryexcited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote whileCoakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relativelypopular, with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with apositive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama'shealth care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President'soverall job performance 44/43.""The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats,"" saidDean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling.

Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's performance as president.In last month's CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty-nine percent disapproved.Analysis: The Irony Behind Obama's Poll NumbersMr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval ratingamong publicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obama's approval rating among independents has declined10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent.Domestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president's approval ratingdownward.Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nation's most pressing issue.Forty-seven percent disapprove. The president's marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate inCongress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are thelowest of Mr. Obama's presidency.Meanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. FewAmericans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating thehealth insurance industry. (ad more on the health care poll results)(CBS)The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than ondomestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama's handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he ishandling the threat of terrorism.While some publicans have criticized the president and Secretary of omeland Security Janet Napolitano's responsesto the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans don't share their opinion.In the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack,and 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent ofpublicans and 55 percent of independents do.More Findings from the Poll:•Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdamon Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, upfrom 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.•While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizensfrom future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence.•Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions ofsuspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.•Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airportsare now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check forhidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines shouldnot be used because they would produce an image of a passenger's naked body and are an invasion of privacy.•Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percentthink it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.•The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44percent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, thepercentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.•The public's overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans saythe economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same."

But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authorswho came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned abackbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.id wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be ""off the record,""aording to a person with knowledge of the exchange.Although id is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched the outside game because of whatone colleague calls a ""penchant for saying things without a filter.""But Jim Manley, id's senior communications adviser, wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with Johneilemann of New York Magazine and Mark alperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working onwhat their publisher had billed as ""a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait"" of the 2008 race.Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with alperin, the longtimepolitical director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with ""The Note.""be id and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed thatalperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that alperin would check back with him on any quoteshe planned to use?Whatever they were thinking, they were wrong.id was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democraticprimaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of hiscaucus, then-New York Sen. illary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts, he let slip something else:Obama could win the White ouse because he was a ""light-skinned"" African-American ""with no Negro dialect, unless hewanted to have one.""The authors write in ""Game Change,"" published this weekend, that id had made the remark ""privately."" They did notsay he had said it to them.As a chagrined id telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support thisweekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.In the book's""Authors' Note,"" they wrote: ""All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with thecandidates themselves — were conducted on a 'deep background' basis, which means we agreed not to identify thesubjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sortdepends.""eilemann said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"": ""We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviewswould be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of thematerial. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were utteringdialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.""alperin added: ""There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with.""Manley, a Capitol ill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoringthe interview and dealing with issues arising from it.But he didn't tell anyone else in id's inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of hisgood relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without hisknowing about it first.Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn't confirm if the interview took place.On  at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed id's staff withquestions about a ""light-skinned"" candidate without a ""Negro dialect.""In the second-guessing that followed, Capitol ill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from aSenate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement.But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-footed by Ambinder's e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO.""They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince alperin not to run it,"" said a Democrat whoparticipated in some of the damage control.Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and otheraides worked until 2 a.m.  to draft id's carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African-American issues.""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,"" the 90-word statement began.Later on , Manley helped lead a counteroffensive, calling White ouse press secretary Robert Gibbs, a friendfrom his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to set up an apology callbetween id, at home in Searchlight, Nev., and Obama back in Washington.In a stunning ""Statement by the President"" e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. , Obama said: ""arry id calledme today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as I'm concerned, the book is closed.""lieved to have the president's solid backing, id's aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to preventany prominent African-American Democrats from attacking id too harshly — or calling for his resignation.id's team correctly anticipated that publicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming abipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting, idwould benefit.Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of  working a call list of about 30 prominentAfrican-Americans across the country. On the calls, he apologized for his words and argued that the book's maintakeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton, long before those made his feelings public.Among those he called were the v. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; p. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.),chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant and talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; ouse MajorityWhip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade enderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and ilary Shelton,director of the NAACP's Washington office.The extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won't be known until . But by, id believed the Washington storm was passing.  his home in New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephonedid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators.id decided that was unnecessary. e had confidently concluded that for now, at least, he had won the inside game."

In bilats today, I learned that some G77 countries are wondering what's in it for them. They're not developingcountries and they're not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is anagency that will benefit women everywhere. I don't know if you'll have an opportunity to say to Brazil's leader that wehope the UN women's agency will continue to have their support. In fact m Shannon told me that they're reallyinterested in women's issues and wanted to sign a MOU with us. Sometimes there's a disconnect between NY perm repsand their capitals2nd, I don't know if you're still going to Chile. If you talk to Bachelet about her future, you can tell that so many govt repsat the UN would like to see her head up the new women's agency. It's not clear if she's even interested.Thx"

4353,4354,109,0,9.0,442,3,1,3,"Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICAEL BARBARO  03, 2010 New York TimesA few weeks ago, arold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor toformer President Bill Clinton.Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge toSenator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.But Mr. Band was not encouraging. e told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across thecountry, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. ""It's not the right thing to do,"" he said,aording to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had beentold that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White ouse had pressured Mr.Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on , came after he reached out to dozens ofdonors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New Yorkresident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired indiscussions of ""who got there first, and who meant it the most,"" on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow apublican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there werefew easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Fordemerged. is voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job atMerrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.Over dinner last  at the Post ouse, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president ofBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. ""I think you should give this serious thought,"" he said, ofthe Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the ideaoff him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot atreaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connectedexecutives, frequently over breakfast at the gency otel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United Statesinvestment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of vlon; and Steven Rattner, thefounder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. ""You can raise themoney,"" he told him in .Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.""She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up"" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to beshallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents therewere ""scared and desperate"" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in hercity.But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late ,the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited locallawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed toseveral up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in NewYork politics than Mr. Ford.""With all due respect,"" he asked Mr. Ford, ""why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?""Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrandwould be harder than it seemed.Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, ""It'sdifficult to make a strong case against her here."" Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth offederal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack hisrelatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger heencountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehementlypushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. e assumed that would put the matter to rest.It did not. ""e was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,"" a friend said.One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for or Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting byquizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman'shealth is in danger?Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cutoff financing for abortions. ""You gave her a pass,"" he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose torun he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: ""We can never support you if you takethese positions."" Mr. Ford ""looked shocked,"" a person in the room said.is meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of theStonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read ""Liar!"" and ""Gohome snake oil arry,"" a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it inCongress.A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving hisadvisers pause. is negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions ofhis record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. ""It was nota slam dunk, at all,"" said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but notinconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson andpresentative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was inseeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.By , he had made up his mind not to run. e told his wife, Emily, and his father, former presentative aroldFord Sr. e began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.""I'm not going to run this time,"" he said in one message. ""Thank you for your support."""

Sid 5, 2010New blow for ries as lead slips in marginalsBy Nigel Morris and Michael SavagePoll shows crumbling support in target seats as DavidCameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom rowThe Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver generalelection victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.The result was a fresh setback for the ry leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over thebillionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft hadmaintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that LordAshcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the ouse of Lordswithout paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior ries have put a brave face on theirsliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has beenmasterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the ry lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just twopoints over the past year.The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the electionexpected on 6 . The survey put the ries on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the ries the largest party after the election, but 11 seats shortof an overall Commons majority.An investigation by The Independent last week found the ries spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by ashadow cabinet member as a ""mountain to climb"".The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commissionconcluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft,were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the oppositeconclusion.owever, the commission added its regret that the ries refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft haddestroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company."

4410,4411,2225,0,7.0,450,3,1,3," 15, 2010Op-Ed ColumnistTaking On ChinaBy PAUL KRUGMANTensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done. give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbiand buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — beganaround 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overallsurplus on its current aount — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.day, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International MonetaryFund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the mostdistortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquiditytrap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates arealready near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on theseeconomies, which they can't offset.So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that ""manipulate the rate of exchange between theircurrency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gainingunfair competitive advantage in international trade."" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwillingto do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six orseven years pretending not to see the obvious.Will the next report, due  15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? ere, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest ratessoar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise ratesuntil the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by marketexpectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback byexpanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.It's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as theeuro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduceour trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollarholdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, asits surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on  Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —that his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that therenminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen aused other nations of doing what China actuallydoes, seeking to weaken their currencies ""just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.""But if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severeproblem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a fewmonths later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard tosee China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge wouldhave to be much larger, say 25 percent.I don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economicproblems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It's time to take a stand.ome• World• U.S.• N.Y. / gion• Business• Technology• Science• ealth• Sports• Opinion• Arts• Style• Travel• Jobs• al Estate• Automobiles• Back to pCopyright 2010 The New York Times Company• Privacy Policy• Terms of Service• Search• Corrections• RSS• First Look• elp• Contact Us• Work for Us• Site Map"

The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting fromconstruction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near thegates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching withgreen Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimatenightmare.The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage processin the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Suchannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,let alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewishneighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods ofFrench ill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem aord ng to every peace plan. Unlike theSnail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the establishedJewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.Why, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why arness ""day of rage"" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's callto gather on the Temple Mount to ""save"" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Whythe sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City's Jewish Quarter,when dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in EastJerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do noless.Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over thelast year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a steptoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewishneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freezethere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was thatPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands aordingly.Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. ThoughPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sitdown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freezein Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.Finally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of ""proximity talks""—settingPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same tablewith Israelis.That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. Buthe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo andelsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he's ensured that thePalestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.Initially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden'shumiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahudeserved the administration's condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: e failed toconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style ofgoverning generally.But not even the opposition aused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement ofthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. onthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, andwhy he aepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within themainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Bidenduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministrythat oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.Its interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking internationalincidents is not its style.Finally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is consideredby Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in theinterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.In turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fightwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.Ac.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple theNetanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given hisineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public isnot likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. Aording to anIsrael Radio poll on  16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percentblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •In the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even thoughthe Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic rootsin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after aterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of ""open season"" against Israelinternationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to theresumption of the peace process—as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its mainstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, hmEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.instead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israelnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as ifIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them. insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider awithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offertwice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak aepted the Clinton Proposals of  2000, andthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, neverreplied.The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine thereturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solutionfrom devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace. achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to aifaand Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo theirclaim to ebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possibledeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority ofIsraelis—along with the political system—has aepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system hasrejected it.In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-state solution but on more limited goals.There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of amas has createdpanic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence ofSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad stilllacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens ofroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.But by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too.  the fictitious notion of a peaceprocess, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.The administration, aording to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidiousausation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies areendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White ouse. Whether or not theremark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning intoa third intifada over Jerusalem.Yossi Klein a/evils a senior fellow of the She/em Center in Jerusalem, and a contributing editor of The New public.WM David Axelrod please be quiet, pease?Posted By 4 '■ (I?

Not bad.http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005ligion and human rightsThe limits of freedom and faithMar 31st 2010 The Economist print editionOpponents of a bid by Muslim states to ""protect religion"" claim a small suessow dare you call us blasphemers?IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms andcrucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in thepublic square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at theUnited Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat.On  25th the uman Rights Council (RC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates itsWestern members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the ""defamation ofreligion"" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference(OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions ofthat kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallestever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a ""defamation"" motion next time onecomes around.The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies anysinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, butnothing more. (The United States Commission on International ligious Freedom, a congressionallymandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person orentity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at leastphysically, alive on earth.)But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the""defamation"" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that useblasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to becoming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against thelatest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be evenhigher. An ""ad hoc committee"" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racialdiscrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want anew convention, or a protocol to the existing one.For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith havingprivileged aess to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are badenough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and giveheart to theocrats.At the RC's latest discussion of this effort in , the Algerian who oversees the project was keen toplough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it wouldbe better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism aordwill resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-betheocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of beingdefeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International umanistand Ethical Union.Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing theabuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. ow fair is their point? It is an easy case to make,for example, over Pakistan.Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country'sindependent uman Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that hasbeen handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis,a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rifenow than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes(over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.""The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged withblasphemy,"" said Ali Dayan asan, a researcher at uman Rights Watch, a campaign group.""But are people convicted? arely. It is used as an instrument of political and socialcoercion.""When convictions our, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan'sparliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the rulingparty to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise itsblasphemy regime.)On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In  2009, in a village in Punjab province, fiveAhmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written""Prophet Muhammad"" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six monthstill the charge was quashed.And last  a young Pakistani Christian was aused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain.It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, andmany Christians had to flee. e was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. is family allegedtorture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians(see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the ""defamation"" of faith that threatens rights butmeasures that supposedly defend it."

SidLabour c.uIi win most seats at eneralelection, poll showsGuardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points — the closest in an ICM poll for almost two years• Julian Glover• aardian.co.uk,  5  2010 19.02 BST• Article historyLbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election, aording to a Guardian/1CM pollpublished today.The findings suggest ry hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed, with the gap between the two mainparties now at just four points — the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years.Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservativebacking has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since  2008 and the ries' worst since.On a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the riesperform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish asecure parliamentary basis for power.Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week.Despite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party hasbeen at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls.Meanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%.At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today's figures will betreated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys.Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have beenaffected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest thatLabour's chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the comingweeks.day's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch allthree. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them.The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they mightback instead.Labour and ry support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while71% of ries also say they will stick with their first choice party.Lib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just overa quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party.The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last askedthis question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives —all their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%.alistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only threepoints since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now.•ICM search interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3  2010.Interviews were conducted across the country, and the results weighted to the profile of all adults. 1CM is a member of theBritish Polling Council and abides by its rules."

I know this is a very difficult time for everyoneat the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you upto speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we needto address:• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle thecommunications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on allaspects of the initiative• Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is verylittle awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide peopleacross the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their waythrough this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; whatprograms are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lackof this sort of ""personally relevant"" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to theoverall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in aitiand last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using awide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in avery granular ,local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady streamof gruesome news being put out by traditional media.• Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness ofthe initiative and maintain public support for the effort• Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in USKeith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDAtaking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able toovercome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I havereached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sectoronce we have a plan of action in place.Finally, with regard to next week's trip by S, Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late rather than have it as part of next week's agenda.

4531,4532,2255,0,7.0,466,3,1,3,"sbwhoeop,  : fyi. sid: Uri Avnery, the Israeli analyst and activist, is privately circulating this analysis today. One consequence: Petraeuscannot run as a publican. At least Putin didn't bring his big dogs in with him like he did with Merkel. Cheers, SidUri Avnery20.3.10The Doomsday WeaponIT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemnedto repeat their mistakes.Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against theRoman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small andinsignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against therival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. Whatchances could the Jewish revolt have?God knows what was going on in the mind of the ""Zealots"". They eliminated the moderateleaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewishpopulation of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Romeand believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhapsthey had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and thetemple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provokethe great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They aeptedcompromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. Theycleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the wholeworld.But since the beginning of the oupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult ofMasada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in publicdiscourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against thenew Rome.WAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing intosomething far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obamawith thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his termhave dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. e gave up his demand for areal settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and hissenior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary ofState illary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity,East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict,including East Jerusalem, and more.The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptianarmy had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all thereserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations inthe US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered itssoldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White ouse.It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obamawould be defeated.And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.TE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general,son of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis,stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a ""distinguished cadet"", in ArmyCommand and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reapedplaudits. e wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served asan assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.e made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematicalcity in the country. e concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must winover the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money thanammunition. The locals called him King David. is suess was considered so outstandingthat his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.is star rose rapidly. e was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soonbecame the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East, except Israel and Palestine (which ""belong"" to the American command in Europe).When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected militarythinker, he has no rivals.TIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in hisAOR (Area Of sponsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the ""root causes of instability"" in the region. Thelist was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: ""The enduring hostilities betweenIsrael and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance ourinterests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception ofU.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength anddepth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens thelegitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militantgroups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in theArab world through its clients, Lebanese izballah and amas.""Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefsof Staff,In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but asupreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sidedsupport for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US wouldchange its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official documentwritten by the responsible American commander.The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Itsspokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn'tunderstand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people inJerusalem break out into cold sweat.AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits— almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightestdeviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel, the immensemight of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize itspower.It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitiveintelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did hisduty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered thelives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court toimpose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests ofsuessive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront hisintelligence chiefs in this matter.But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlockolmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewishcommunity fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for thegovernment of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt thesecurity of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans,snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above theirheads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be aused of putting the security of Israelahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly themantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. Thepolicy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraqand Afghanistan.FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not beenwidely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews havestarted to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. e declared thatObama is an ""anti-Semite"". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obamais really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and inwriting that ""ussein"" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the comingcongressional elections and in the next presidential ones.(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far fromconvinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel isfair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the ausation that Israelputs the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequencesfor Israel.For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship inorder to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the•present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long asthe present coalition in Israel stays in power.When the movie ""urt Locker"" won its awards, the entire American public was united in itsconcern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convincedthat Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just forhim."

Sid• Print this page Times Online 14, 2010ry lead narrows amid huge voterdisenchantment, Times poll findsolmage :1 of 20,Peter RiddellThe general election race is tightening, aording to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep publicdisenchantment with the campaign so far.The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than eithera ry or a Labour outright victory.Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 percent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average.With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifestolaunch. ry strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the ries on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. Thiswould point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),against 28 per cent wanting a ry majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour thanthe ries in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they wantLabour or the ries in either a majority or a minority government.The poll shows that the number expecting a ry overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the pastweek. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with aweek ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the ries to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honestabout their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting thedeficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to whichthey can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducingthe increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the ries); allowing unsuessful schools, hospitalsand the police (the ries, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the ries not Labour); and requiring foreign workersemployed in public services to speak fluent English (the ries not Labour).In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party makingthe proposal.In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreignworkers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuessful schools, hospitals etc.More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say ""none of the parties"", or ""don't know"", when askedwhich party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the ries and 18 percent Labour.Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on  evening. Men andmiddle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect DavidCameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More ries (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 percent) expect their leader to win.Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not surethat it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to theries.Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on  12 to 13.

The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entirepower-sharing executive is dysfunctional.Sir g Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powersunless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.Following the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson,the first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from thedeputy first minister's office.A UUP spokesman said: ""An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist partyon policing and justice. e ridiculously aused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded thedeputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont.""Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unaeptable to Sinn Fein — unfortunately for Mr McGuinness, a party votingagainst a motion with which it disagrees is basic, normal democratic politics.""The spokesman added that McGuinness's ""angry and aggressive attempt to lecture"" the UUP was ""wholly unaeptable"".""When challenged on his tone, the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolutionfrom Martin McGuinness.""If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing, then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive isdysfunctional.""If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist, non-sectarian Allianceparty, David Ford, will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. owever the nationalist party isangry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as theywant to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.US Congress warns Cameron over danger offailed Ulster police dealYes vote on illsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month• Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent• guardian.co.uk,  7  2010 22.12 GMT• Article historyUS secretary of state illary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron's apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUPpartners.

Democratic and publican leaderswill both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of theGood  Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.Sir g Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policingand criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month — a key nationalist demand — in return for the long-standingunionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. illary Clinton, the US secretary of state who has taken a keeninterest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency, spent15 minutes talking to Empey by phone, aording to BBC Northern Ireland.But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that agroup of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP, whichrecently formed an electoral pact with the ries, to vote yes.The unease among the US Congress members is shared by illary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would bewell advised to follow the example of John Major, who was respected as an impartial referee.The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William ague. The shadow foreignsecretary is saying that, despite their political differences, he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.But all sides need to be careful. The ries, who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP, believe that ministersneed to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morningtrumpeting a poll, commissioned by them, which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But, asSlugger O'ole notes, there is some debate about the methodology.""It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown's beloved dividinglines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong,"" one ry tells me."

The pact has prompted fears inWashington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in theearly years of the peace process.The Guardian understands that the White ouse is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, DeclanKelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence topersuade Empey to vote for the deal.""There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this,"" said one sourcefamiliar with the transatlantic negotiations. ""This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out.""Another source familiar with the contact said: ""This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post-presidency period. e has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White ouse. e has maintainedradio silence.""One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: ""The fact that George W Bushhas decided to intervene is really significant. e was interested in the peace process as president and appointed anenvoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to.""A ry source said: ""George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. Davidunderlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannotforce Sir g to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, 'I can see you are engaged.""The disclosure of Bush's intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorsethe deal brokered last month at illsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would seepolicing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month.B6The UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it isfoolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function.

It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the ""final status"" issues, as they'reoften called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.This devotion to ""constructive ambiguity"" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40years. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viablesettlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the ""right of return"" toIsrael -- suessive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.But the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du..ripq. visit ily__Vde PresidentBiden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in ,lerusal.erp. The Obama administration was upset, to put itmildly: Secretary of State illary Clinton called the housing announcement a ""deeply negative signal"" about U.S.-Israelirelations and ""an insult.""In the ensuing hubbub over the ""crisis"" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all amisunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that's a mistake.The East Jerusalem move wasn't an aident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right's rejection ofconcessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzzthe issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,basically called his bluff.""Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do,"" said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeliambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:""Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?""So what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the bestefforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles thatmust frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former nationalsecurity adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutualadjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the pastfour decades has converged toward those parameters.The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began itspeacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this ""big bang"" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,the national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in theNorthern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridgingproposals.Rather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu onsettlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama's first months in office, confident that hewas so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coollybided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finallyagreed in  to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administrationshould have seen what was coming.In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proveddestructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal withoutmaking concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakershave wanted to save it for last. But this month's crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right,the Jerusalem issue is joined.What's needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views aboutJerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahurefuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations.davidignatius_@washpost.cornPost a CommentView all comments that have been posted about this article.Comments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from thesite.

Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty ImagesThe final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today, giving the province its first justice ministersince the Troubles erupted four decades ago.Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry, completing the lastact of the Good  agreement.But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives' allies in Northern Ireland, the UlsterUnionists, and their 18-strong assembly team, voted against the move.Despite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes, the party refused to back the historicmeasure.The party's stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast, but hiselectoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an""honest broker"" when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont.day's vote came just before 5pm, when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP andsmaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast.But the UUP resisted pressure — from, among others, former US president George Bush — to support the measure.Speaking on the assembly floor, Sir g Empey, the UUP leader, said his party had voted no ""as a democratic politicalto a friendhareendILir•ontact user I smallerparty pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland, and we exerciseour rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.""The deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced the UUP stance, claiming it was intended toembarrass the DUP.""The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution,"" McGuinness told the assembly.""That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.""In a statement after the vote, Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. ""day the politics of progresshave finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland,"" the prime minister said. ""The completion of devolution,supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the mostpowerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail.""The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.""The Conservatives welcomed the vote, without mentioning the UUP's rejection of the move. A ry spokesman said: ""Wewelcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved andfor it to be decided by local politicians.""But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to ""clarify the position of his ry-UUP alliance on the devolution of policingand justice powers"".Alistair Carmichael, their spokesman on Northern Ireland, said: ""With the UUP saying one thing, and the ries saying thecomplete opposite, voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint ry-UUP candidates stand for. What we're seeingis the ries in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason, it's clear that DavidCameron has dug himself a very big hole.""Carmichael added: ""This raises serious questions about David Cameron's judgment. If he can't manage to steer a straightcourse in opposition, how on earth would he cope as prime minister?""Earlier there was acrimony in the Great all at Stormont when a victims' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ againstMcGuinness.Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent latives threw the legal document in McGuinness's direction afterthe deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn FeinMP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA's campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist's fatherwas shot dead by the IRA.The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP ""had betrayed me and other victims"" by agreeingto devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the policeand judiciary even though the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party leader, David Ford, will be the first justice minister.Frazer said: ""I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and nowthey have done a complete somersault.

SANGER and TOM SANKERPublished:  18, 2010WASINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top Whiteouse officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progresstoward nuclear capability, aording to government officials familiar with the document.Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in  to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White ouse and the intelligence agencies todevelop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to beconsidered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and notsections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,described the document as ""a wake-up call."" But White ouse officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 monthsthey had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.In an interview on , General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: ""On Iran, we are doingwhat we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to seedoesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.""But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iranchoose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts itneeds for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a""virtual"" nuclear weapons state.Aording to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might containIran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could beobtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likelypossibility.Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. is spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in thedocument, but issued a statement on  saying, ""The secretary believes the president and his national securityteam have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range ofcontingencies with respect to Iran.""Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there wasa line Iran would not be permitted to cross.The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not ""acquire a nuclear capability,"" a step Tehrancould get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. ""That includes the ability to have a breakout,"" he said,using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses itstechnology to build a small arsenal.Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw adifference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. ""I'm not going to parse that rightnow,"" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,as he said, ""became a self-professed nuclear state.""Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final stepstoward producing a weapon. Last  on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" he said: ""If their policy is to go tothe threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually knowhow you would verify that."" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, ""It's going slow -slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.""Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career toissue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the UnitedStates was not adequately prepared.e wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomaticengagement.Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped thatthe revelation by Mr. Obama in  that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountainnear Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent inwhat proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for amedical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the Whiteouse did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official""chairman's guidance"" to his staff saying that while any military option would have ""limited results"" against Iran'snuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.""Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,"" the admiral wrote.Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were underway. So did General Jones. ""The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to beprepared for every possible contingency,"" he said in the interview. ""That is what we have done from day one, whilesuessfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.""At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the DefenseIntelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military'smost experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclearweapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, includingplacing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly"

First of all, their friendship with the US andrespect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hostedfor me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he'shoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements forEastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with thePresident and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meetingwith the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.One of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safebirthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for moreopportunities to work together.I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitudefor our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is animportant time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last severalyears.We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments forfuture concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in  for the CDministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. e told me he got a very positiveresponse for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new genderinstitute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.The Dutch minister who camesaid the outcome of their election in  will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their griefwas palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so manyof their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very activein advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries."

The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandalare yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity as acovert CIA officer.is distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair. Wasting hisopportunity to tell the truth, he offers absolutely nothing new, and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparenteffort to continue his long campaign to confuse people, unfortunately consistent with his past behavior.is book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration, involving ourcountry in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America.Nothing in Karl Rove's book refutes those facts. is book, however, is illuminating in further exposing his politicalmethods, especially his reliance on personal insults, not simply towards Valerie and myself, but also towards all thosewho opposed his unprincipled behavior.If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed, Rove's book demonstrates once again the actionsof a vindictive, angry and petty man.

Empey, theminister for employment and learning, said: ""We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to whichwe have been subjected in recent weeks.""The UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backeddevolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today's vote, while former USpresident George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal.Empey's unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after thevote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back thedevolution deal, said: ""The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forwardtogether as a society.""The vote secures an extra £800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. Italso adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue thatalmost broke the power-sharing government.e said: ""day the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion ofdevolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sendsthe most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courageand leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.""The vote was also praised tonight by illary Clinton, the US secretary of state. Shesaid: ""I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of theillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing andjustice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of thepeople of Northern Ireland for generations to come.""Irish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. ""day's vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents aneloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good  Agreement,"" she said.Matt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. ""Devolutionwill strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, butthat we are committed to delivering.""The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past andwho have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community.""But there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move.Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it toembarrass the DUP. ""The UUP declared last night [] that they will not support this resolution,"" McGuinness toldthe assembly. ""That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party politicalreasons."" e stressed that no single party could control the justice department.The UUP no-vote will put pressure on the ries, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having takenopposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007.Cameron insisted that the ries had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. ""Wewant to move Northern Ireland politics forward — to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives — ratherthan remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics toNorthern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status.""Cameron's remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White ouse, which fears a UUP no-vote could hardenunionist opinion against power-sharing.ardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakawayTraditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had ""rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein"". e alsosuggested the new justice minister would be a ""pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein"". Prior to the votethe widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties toback the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRAsniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: ""It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians toget on with their job."""

As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. eight helped galvanize amovement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""s in Mississippi"" meetings that broughtblack and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for whatshe knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to knowDr. eight, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the earlydays at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example. the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bustof Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. eight and heraomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied aess to the college of her choice because of thecolor of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. eight dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans shouldhave the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer forthe life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched.

KRISTOFJUBA, SudanUntil he reached the White ouse, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure onSudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Westernmonitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeplyflawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, sayingthey would be ""as free and as fair as possible."" The White ouse showed only a hint more backbone with a hurriedreference this week to ""an essential step"" with ""serious irregularities.""President Omar assan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes againsthumanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. is regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he wasquoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: ""Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is againstour will.""Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America isin his pocket, it's time to review your policy.Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's areasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues havemanifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism ofthe government.It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanesegovernment gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-southcivil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided fora referendum, scheduled to take place in , in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They areexpected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of thecountry's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.""If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war,"" predicts Mudawi IbrahimAdam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. e cautions that America's willingness to turn a blindeye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.""They're very naïve in Washington,"" Mr. Mudawi said. ""They don't understand what is going on.""On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, thenation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south willmuddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.ere in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the northattacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. er father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made herway to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returnedfor the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 milesnorthwest of Juba.The trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one washome. Ms. Wol was crushed.Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flewinto each other's arms. me, it felt like a peace dividend.Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. ""I don't wantwar,"" she said, ""but I don't think they will allow us to separate.""My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reducethe risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon."

Faced withgovernment incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.By Max BlumenthalDec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of CiudadJuarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugatedtin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. er hands had been tied, and the evidencesuggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been deadfor seven months.owever horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similarcircumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lotnot far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is noreliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of thedeaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. undreds more women have simply vanished.Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late  had probably come to Juarez from thepoverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known asmaquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And likethem, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knowswho is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have producedallegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killersmust have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they arethe sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from thehighest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far areonly a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the populationin the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides ofpeople have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and lawenforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- andthey have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. day, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless OldWest, but with a grim 21st century edge.Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they haveyet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption ishindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policytowards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating inJuarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved familymembers and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking outeven if it means threats and other reprisals.Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authoritieshave done little to investigate. ""Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,"" themother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. ""They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a weeklater, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally gotwitnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.""Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape andmurder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions ofits efforts at economic expansion. understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conferenceand asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federalgovernment was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery Countywere complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the numberof victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.That's Juarez today.The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modernshopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the nationalaverage; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 orso maquiladoras for their livelihoods. aommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is aluxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimescan be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind themaquiladoras' featureless walls.Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violentcolonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,electricity or paved roads.Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio ColosioValle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by avast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry backand forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was wheremany of the slain and missing women were last seen.In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Insidethe store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.""A lot of girls were picked up here,"" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. ""But really, it's the girls' fault. It's becauseeven though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to getinto those cars if they didn't want to.""Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offeredby officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.""Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it endsviolently,"" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. ""It's difficult toknow.""A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a largemajority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone andwith little means of contacting their families back home.The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as muchas $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women arecaught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem sohigh to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with littlepretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.Even for those who aept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that ownmaquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investmentsubsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On  29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitormanufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On  1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plantdown. Aording to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since theirpeak in  2000.Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's healthsystem, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing theircompany policies, aording to a  article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in alone.The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtuallyinvisible. And that has made them easy prey. Aording to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slainwomen were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyedupon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night ofdrinking.Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. Theeffect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- haveposted banners on their factories reading: ""STOP TE VIOLENCE.  Better Our City, Let's Unite."" But most foreigncompanies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They havemaintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. er body was found in  2001 along with sevenothers in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across thestreet from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., aDetroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darknessof the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes lateafter missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from theirshifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. erworst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any publicstatements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from anotherwave of violence. ""Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,"" she said. ""[Gonzalez's murder] did not happenon Lear property.""When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for herwith responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarioussituation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent homefrom Lear's plant on her last day.""We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,"" Puchalsky said. ""When she had arrived late to work hershift, she was not there in time to work her shift.""When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working theirshifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear'soperations. ""There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,"" she said. ""Typically what we dois if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrivelate, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.""The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in  2001,and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from CiudadJuarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. Shewas held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told theJuarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, callingit erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.Aording to a  article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar nez Grijalva said Garciawas killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in  2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney GeneralArturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure tofabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs oftorture on the aused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.Four months later, in  2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez'soveralls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators hadfailed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: ""The state police have done a thoroughlyprofessional job. I have no doubt about that."" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators hadproperly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civilsociety has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimouslyexpress fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.""We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,"" said one municipalpolice officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. ""There are too few of usand the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like copsin the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get anybetter here.""The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little suess in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become abreeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate ofparanoia.Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garciawas found with marks on her wrists that, aording to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by policehandcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someonepowerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they haveno evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but arebeing protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linkedto powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman aused as serial killermasterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident ofTexas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drugtrafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. owever, evidence against Sharif issuspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.In 1996, Sharif was aused of paying the gang Los beldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiringfive bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers todeflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence andthe possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, ratherthan presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptianbackground. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry outthe killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark search and Technology. But aordingto an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interviewlast week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined todiscuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. ""We don't believe that the guys they havearrested are the killers,"" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. ""It's obvious that they're justscapegoats.""Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. ""day the killings continue becausethere are many imitators,"" she told Salon last week. ""But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for ayear."" But aording to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from 1995 to  1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By onepopular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory positsa financial motive for murder. ""We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,"" says a young municipalpolice officer who declined to give his name. ""Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot ofmoney in the U.S."" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only ahunch.Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. Butwhere such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked anincipient revolt.On her radio show ""Grueso Calibre"" (""Large Caliber""), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guestswho were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon aused the two bus drivers ofthe cotton field murders in  2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs andwas romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that thereceipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.Then, in , when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director ofNuestras ijas greso a Casa (Our Daughters Back ome), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequentguest on ""Grueso Calibre."" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and policeincompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.In Nuestras ijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a ""For nt"" sign out front,Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. ""Rascon came all the way toJuarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,"" she tells Salon. ""Then I got a message onmy phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them."" Rascon, in an earlier story by the AssociatedPress, denied the allegation.Last , Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attemptwas orchestrated by Rascon's office since it ourred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meetingwith the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into themurders.Victims' parents who came to Nuestras ijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have beenthreatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnappedin 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez andAguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected localfamily. an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez auses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of thekidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassedno one. ""I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody,"" she said. ""On the contrary, we support the families andthey are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.""Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did notexactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.""But it's too late to stop now,"" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in . It was anunprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the sevenothers were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from thevigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.owever, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, aording to a Sept. 4article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for ""establishing North Americanindustries, today the most important in the world."" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [AntigoneCollective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focusedon Juarez's crisis of violence.Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in anexpansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective'sgoals and the problems confronting the group. ""Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments areprincipally concerned with the manipulation of life,"" he says. ""The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is forreparation and simply regaining our daily lives.""Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in . e describes the building of animpromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to ""communicate through a differentlanguage, one that's symbolic."" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, ""Antigone,""which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva hasorganized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wallspanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. OnNov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring thevictims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of thevictims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras ijas, the collective placed acoffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.""It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort ofreaction from the people,"" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. ""People are no longer affected by what ishappening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.""While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drasticallydifferent means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyondthe municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group calledBanda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one ofBanda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massiveearthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. day, Banda Civil's members still lend their help duringnatural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-awareness campaign.Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says.""I've narrowly escaped violence many times,"" she explains. ""Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens tocome by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's ourindignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them.""Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had suesswhere most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudialvette Gonzalez's overalls in , humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providingmembers with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. Aording to Guerra, over 300 people haveaompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searchesare a family activity.On one recent , the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as peoplestood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murdersare ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps thequiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.""Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions,"" says Santos. ""We all havesisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.""-- By Max Blumenthal[3(Copyright © 2010 Salon Media Group, Inc. production of material from any Salon pages without written permission isstrictly prohibited.

Op-Ed ContributorGermany in Need of a DreamBy JON KORNBLUMas Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is nolonger the motor of European integration? as Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the FrauleinGermania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, myBlackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for Germansociety. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability andpeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus. the first days of the Federal public. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solelywithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did notremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.Many important postwar aomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition ofothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushedthem with determination.elmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. e agreed to French desires for a commoncurrency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The eurostability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastwardexpansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused byGermany's suess in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded inpursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. ""Europe"" in the institutional sense has becomeincreasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the GermanConstitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance toGreece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German TeaParty?ere we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the ""motor of Europe."" Ms. Merkel'sunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels.  many, it signified the decline of Germanwillingness to ""salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,"" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones whocan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption thatcharacterizes many E.U. programs.Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question iswhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so surethat its focus on stability and aountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to aglobalized world.And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not thatGermany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many otherswhen it once aused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning toburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense ofcommon purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselvesoften tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when theyrallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to ""Dare to ope,"" which is thecharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. Americaseems busy elsewhere.The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building ademocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting tohaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big forGermany or even Europe to aomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will bejoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harnessmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will beassured.European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream andthe United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize.  hold up itsside of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.John Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador toGermany from 1997 to 2001."

ConferenceBy JONATAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIAThe U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeksto prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins .U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by somefor its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, asIran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significantprogress has been made on Mideast peace.The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with abang  with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusalto disarm and for tacitly aepting Israel's nuclear capability.Secretary of State illary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies havebeen pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.""The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,"" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. Theofficial highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emergedfrom a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been takensince.Senior Obama administration officials said  the White ouse is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclearweapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egyptwould resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran andTurkey.""We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,"" said the seniorU.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances inArab-Israeli peace talks.""We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikelyunless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is aepted,"" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for armscontrol and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other membersof the Nonaligned Movement.The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-securityconference in Washington in  due to such concerns.An Israeli official said  that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that""it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all thecountries in the region.""The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building newJewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days thatties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said  that the Mideast peace process will get on tracknext week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administrationwants to see.Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament ""as soon as possible."" It also called for Israel's nuclear program to beplaced under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won'tbe aepted, U.S. officials said.The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release ""all information available to them on the nature andscope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.""U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task ofcalling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.""They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,"" said enry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-ProliferationEducation Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. aeptance of aspecial envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, waspart of the U.S. offer.The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for thisconference for nearly a year.The White ouse wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections andsanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could helpnations develop peaceful nuclear power.Write to Jonathan Weisman at jonathan.weisman@wsj.com, Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Joe Lauria atnewseditor@wsj.com"

Richard Lugar, R-IN, ""The crisis should not be used as an excuse to winincreases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donorcommunity, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform.""The report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committeechairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can doto update their relevance.""Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bankfor construction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to betteraddress our needs? ow should we re-design them?"" the report asks.""Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions ofmoney from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States.""The Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration hasrequested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB.A committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing themoney.""We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed,"" the staffersaid. ""It's not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress.""The reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more ondevelopment goals rather than the structure and size of loans and ""work with the other donor countries to step backand slow down the process,"" the staffer said.Congress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms,considering that Obama issued a signing statement in  indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressionaldirection on such international negotiations.Negotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris,deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury's Office of International Development Finance and Debt.The issue will next surface at the end of  when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annualmeeting in Cancun.Michael .

A few vignettes.- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs lastweek, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EAC of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are longand pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarinis met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes fromthe ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo'swhen you and President come on the screen.- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it andthe bison stuffed animals - who knew?Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report.

Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regimeand an important bridge between the volutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So hiswords are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.day he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although thestatement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood.

With him we were winning everywhere andAmerica's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationallytowards the United States...""[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why wewould not aept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]""day we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased theirnumber which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had saidthat he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Didthis happen? Of course not...""[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, ourfavorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'ireligious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic public and are increasingly competing with us, insteadof following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. ow can we attack them with astraight face when they behave this way!]""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]opposition towards the Iranian nation...""[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every timewe sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on theuranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized andrespected...""[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder ifSarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]""The Islamic public has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding newfriends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...""[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution.

4784,4785,2476,0,7.0,501,3,1,3,"sbwhoeop,  25, 2010 10:16 AM: aaretz chief columnist on Bibi's visit. Sidhtto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. htmlAluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weakerBy Ake BermDetails emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonethelessbe drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-mending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - onlyhighlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.Instead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issueaside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control overEast Jerusalem.AdvertisementThe most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution ofthe peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.At the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, atwhich he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.Taking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish peopleitself and its millennia of history.is speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. ading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquishWest Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.But at the White ouse, the prime minister's speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheeringcongressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.Knowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over theweekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip here two weeks ago, andU.S. Secretary of State illary Clinton described Netanyahu's response to the ultimatums Washington presented to himas ""useful.""Special envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister's bureau  to invite Netanyahu to theWhite ouse. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.Far from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for adressing down.This time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittalanswers to the Americans' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians thatshould they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.is arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could callthe next few steps of the diplomatic dance.But then calamity struck. At their White ouse meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu hadsent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu wastreated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.The revolution in the Americans' behavior is clear to all. On  morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead tothe ouse of presentatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement withcongressmen over ties with Israel.The moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.The Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in , Netanyahu was invited to theWhite ouse at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White ousespokesman challenged Netanyahu's observation at AIPAC that ""Jerusalem is not a settlement.""The Americans didn't even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behaviorWashington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.The approval of construction at the Shepherd otel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, againcaught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent suchsurprises failed its first test.Netanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocatethe planned emergency room at Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt throughWashington.turning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will notrelent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or withthe settlers."

Obviously in the short term, searchand rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to belittle communication between the various areas where people have congregatedand a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additionalsupplies including food, water and medical.I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind oftouch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. Iwould set up a central command that has representatives from all federalagencies in one place. There is no reason things should be thisdisorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person tobe the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsiblefor all activities within their grid and will report activities to theisland on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola toset up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radiosso everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the commandpost and with each other.I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security forthe rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for theoperation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling allincoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I alsothink DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requestedby each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters shouldbe used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to theaircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinatorassigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsiblefor getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularlyregarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue.The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become morechaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary wereto talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would besupportive of better coordination.Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strongpeople in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretaryand get things under control quickly.I hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions pleasefeel free to call me on my cell We leave for kyo at 7:15 amtomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.Please give the Secretary my best regards.

Itwas blazoned atop the Foreign Policy website, the most widely read site on international affairs daily, owned andpublished by the Washington Post. Below the piece is a note by its writer about his sourcing that appeared on a smallwebsite elsewhere. Also, I've included an article by Max Blumenthal, who spends his time on this issue and plans to moveto Israel for about 6-8 months to write a book. e tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press. Sidhttp://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_storyThe Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassmentis not the whole storyPosted By Mark Perry 4,  13, 2010 -On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit aiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs ofStaff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOMcommander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception amongArab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losingfaith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing inthe region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) ""too old, too slow ... andtoo late.""The  Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself onwhat is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followedfrom a  2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.""Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,"" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. ""Americawas not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding."" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two daysafter the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White ouse requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, withIsrael, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reasonwas straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arableaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied  that Petraeus sent a paper to the White ouse.""CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM didpropose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the W,"" the officer said via email. ""GEN Petraeus was not certain whatmight have been conveyed to the W (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.""(UCP means ""unified combatant command,"" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and W is the White ouse.)]The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White ouse like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request thatCENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (""it was dead on arrival,"" a Pentagon officer confirms),the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue,sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with thechief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's tripfocused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: thatIsrael had to see its conflict with the Palestinians ""in a larger, regional, context"" -- as having a direct impact on America'sstatus in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahugovernment was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outragedthan Biden who, aording to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with theIsraeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached toPetraeus's Mullen briefing: ""This is starting to get dangerous for us,"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. ""What you're doinghere undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and itendangers regional peace."" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: ""The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since manypeople in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any decision aboutconstruction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety ofAmerican troops fighting against Islamic terrorism."" The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could costAmerican lives.There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and theIsraeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits mightreflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the realbreak came in , when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America'srelationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. be Israel gets the messagenow.Mark Perry's newest book is Talking  Terroristshttp://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has oasioned a great deal of comment, aswell as some skepticism: how aurate is the aount? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Isthere any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expandCENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.I won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — whothey are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in thebriefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for thereader to determine. The aount is not only aurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more toit. The White ouse, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the aount, and for good reason: it's true.Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, isthe authoritative aount on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. Ihave never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that GeneralPetraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhancetheir own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his countryand he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test ofGeneral Petraeus's loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of ""the Biden crisis"" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated intowhether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security, it's aboutour security.http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/Netanyahu and Pastor agee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden'sArrival in IsraelOn 03.09.10, By Max(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved theconstruction of 1600 new homes in Oupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission tohelp jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset hisplans by Netanyahu's appearance with John agee.The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a daybefore Biden's arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John agee in Jerusalem. The oasion was agee'sNight  onor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations toIsraeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.At the gathering, agee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""the itler of the Middle East"" and denouncedthe Goldstone port as ""character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.""Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as ""the undivided,eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, ""I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!"" e used the rest ofhis speech to call for ""tough, biting sanctions"" against Iran that ""bite deep into its energy sector.""agee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:r--XIn the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem orNir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegalWest Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitivebillionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressionaldelegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.Part One of agee's speech:XPart Two.XPastor agee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo.agee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John agee Ministries thattotaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion andShomron, which was involved in promoting an ""Obama illtop project"" that promoted more settlement building andcompared Obama to Pharoah. agee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated fromGush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israelgovernment to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.Who is agee funding in Israel?XWho Is aoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.The most notable of agee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of thisgroup appeared in the film to thank agee for ""help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the pathof Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity."" Another student called for ""the second revolution in Israel.""In , Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director NaomiChazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly aused the New IsraelFund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone port.The smear campaign led to unsuessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israelihuman rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, acolumnist for a'aretz, called Im Tirtzu ""a McCarthyite movement"" for its attacks on Chazan.Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during CUFI'sJerusalem ceremony suggested that agee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.publican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of agee during his 2008 presidential campaign afteragee's statements describing the olocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. agee has also said thathe believed the anti-Christ was ""partially Jewish, as was Adolph itler."" owever, none of agee's comments havedeterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or aepting his millions in annual charity.During agee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source ofdifficulties between the US and Israel. ""The settlements are not the problem,"" he boomed from the podium. ""The problemis the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.""agee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when heproclaimed, ""World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do inthe city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannotlive there.""The following day, on  9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials fromthe Palestinian Authority. e told reporters after touching down that he saw ""a moment of real opportunity."""

The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have tolearn to be less deferential to US presidents and be ""willing to say no"" to America.The report, entitled Global Security: UK-US lations, says Britain's relationship with America is ""extremely close andvaluable"" in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. owever, it adds that the use of the phrase specialrelationship, in its historical sense, ""is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided"".It does not reflect the ""ever-evolving"" relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPssay.""Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past,"" the committeeadds.In an apparent rebuke to ny Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are ""manylessons"" to be learnt from Britain's political approach towards the US over Iraq.""The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both amongthe British public and overseas,"" the MPs say. ""This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to thereputation and interests of the UK.""While the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealingsbetween the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. ""The UK needs to be less deferential andmore willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries' interests and values diverge,"" the MPs say.They are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review ofthe use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinaryrendition.""The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbingquestions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put"", the MPs say.They express regret at ""considerable restraints"" on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise USactivities carried out on British territory.""We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governingUS military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories."" The review should ""identify shortcomings inthe current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these"".The report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regardingthe alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident.Last month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed thatMI5 was aware of the torture.Senior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing someintelligence with Britain.Contact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The  Times, orplace your advertisement.Times Online Services: Dating I Jobs I Property Search I Used Cars I olidays I Births lvlarriages, Deaths ISubscrlptions I E-paperNews International associated websites: MilkroundCopyright 2010 Times Newspapers Ltd.This service is provided on Times Newspapers' standard Terms and Conditions.

The Quartetreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weaponssmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and thereunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow ofhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Councilresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government andinternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation ofthe Agreement on Aess and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet presentative have worked with Israel, as well asconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy inGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartetnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring theeffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towardsmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction andinfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to workwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented asquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, inconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It willactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings andpromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of localnon-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fullyenable this work.The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believesefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and aess for Palestinian people and goods are critical. TheQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms andammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that theircargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need forunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of hiscapture on  25; it further condemns the violation of amas' international obligation to provide him aess by theInternational Committee of the d Cross and demands that amas immediately remedy the situation.The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of directbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes thesenegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the oupationwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in theWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours."

Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at everyturn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, mostnotably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk(the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed,Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministersmeet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state-building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the developmentcommissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy andthen presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on theway the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here.I hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY.

But WikiLeaks haspreviously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified.The report by a CIA expert on ""strategic communications"" and State Department analysts of public opinionwarned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse, citing the recent fall ofthe Dutch government over the issue.""The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civiliancasualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediatewithdrawal,"" it said.The analysis, dated  11, suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germanyand France, which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan.""Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French,German, and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in WesternEurope toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission,"" it said.Public relations efforts could ""tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees,"" the report said,suggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops.Such an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeatedand ""leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.""""The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke Frenchindignation, become a rallying point for France's largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support agood and necessary cause despite casualties.""For German audiences, marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about theNATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany's interests.""For example, messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany's exposure toterrorism, opium, and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics,"" it said.The report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obama's popularity in France and Germany,arguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positiveeffect.The memorandum is titled: ""Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission -- WhyCounting on Apathy Might e Enough.""Media Analysis and Watch CenterUSSTRATCOM Foreign Media Analysis ProgramSOS International Ltd.www.sosiltd.com"

The speech suggested that USnonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselvesand that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointedattacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us""the most hated"" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have usednuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 ""proposals"", most of which were previewedin Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten withnuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech."

When Nixonwanted foreign policy advice, everyone knewwhere he got it from: enry 'Kissinger, variouslyhis national security adviser and secretary ofstate.In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policystrategist. Even insiders give different answerswhen asked to whom he turns for advice on thebig international questions. But almost all agreewith the following observation. ""The truth is thatPresident Obama is his own enry Kissinger —no one else plays that role,"" says a senior official.""Every administration reflects the personality ofthe president. This president wants all the trainsBarack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike hispredecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to enry Kissinger foradvice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategistrouted through the Oval Office.""Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised tospeak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a longtime around, Mr Obama himself.Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passagelast week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, saycritics.""On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely,"" says the official. ""On the debitside, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. e just doesn't havemuch depth on some issues.'The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White ouse-based National Security Council, which advisesthe president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to manypeople's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows littleinterest in running the ""inter-agency"" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travelsfrequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National SecurityCouncil, known as the ""principals meeting"", not Gen Jones.Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. ""If you were to ask me who the real national securityadviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom hm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the leastimportant,"" says another official.Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreigngovernments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, hedoes not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, GenJones provoked laughter when he said: ""I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually didwhat you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.""The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as hisenvoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arabconfidence in the talks.In a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvgli..0f7;ce. last , in which Mr Netanyahu refused to aede to Mr Obama's demand, theonly officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.""The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what thenext step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?"" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration andformer head of the Council on Foreign lations. ""Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?""Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by m Donilon, deputynational security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent ""deputies' meetings"", whichcan sometimes consume four to six hours a day.Described by one insider as ""the most powerful man in the White ouse whose name isn't widely known"", Mr Donilon,who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there area lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as ""clinically insane"" by a formersenior diplomat under Bill Clinton.But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. ""Peopleforget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush'stwo terms] in America's power and reputation in our history,"" says a senior official. ""It took time to put in place a processthat could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.""Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed toprevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to GeorgeBush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of ""parallelprocess"" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.""If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it,"" says thesenior official. ""By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.""The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. MrSteinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John oldren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the USambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clintonadministration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: ""A lot of work gets done in that group,"" saysMs Flournoy. ""Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.""The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in  tosend another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of OvalOffice meetings.But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.""Time is the most precious commodity a president has,"" says a former national security adviser. ""On average he is onlygoing to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.""The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and DenisMcDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all arewidely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's ""Lord igh Executioner"", Mr McDonough ""has appended himself to the Chicagocrowd"", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama'sforeign policy apparatus.Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader m Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's sideduring the campaign. Insiders describe him as the ""enforcer"" and as the keeper of ""message discipline"", a key element ofany campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.""McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,"" saysan official. ""Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.""Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. ""Donilon hasbeen perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,"" says David Rothkopf, a formerClinton official and scholar on the NSC. ""Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process thatwas taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited.""Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-levelmeetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they areabsent, such as on the president's decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in  2011 — arecommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.On the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plusside also, if it has to be White ouse-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.Bush.""At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with areal lawyer's clarity,"" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. ""Whenthe president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.""When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTSAn 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circleIf there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White ouse-centric, it is in thealliance between illary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong workingrelationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokespersoninternationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for thecredibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As aholdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is nocoincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably onAfghanistan, where both suessfully urged the deployment of more troops.""Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,"" says one official, who notesthat while the traditional role of the NSC is to ""play referee"" between the state and defence departments,it is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White ouse. This is very different from howit worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.""We work together well,"" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. ""I think itstarts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge thatthe secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.""Their outlooks often overlap.  the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending ondiplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour toughsanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relationswith the Kremlin.But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of theObama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant ""residue of friction""between Mr Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, aording to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, MrsClinton's chief of staff, has had several run-ins with others in the administration.One official describes Mrs Clinton as ""totally loyal"" to Mr Obama. e adds: ""She and the president are notthe best of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to apresident and she wanted to be one ... She still might be.""Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

4942,4943,109,0,9.0,515,3,1,3,"After Afghan Shift, p U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASINGTON — As General David .Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and trickyfuture, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them onnotice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. olbrooke, the Obama administration's specialrepresentative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in theuproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at leastone senior White ouse official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, aording tosenior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support,these people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberrymight be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnershipwith General Petraeus during the suessful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr.Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines thechallenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about howsoldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that GeneralPetraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker innegotiations between President amid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before GeneralPetraeus's arrival, some critics said the White ouse had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitiouspersonalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as onesaid, ""there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the White ouse believes that thecurrent lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up hasreverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State illary Rodham Clinton instructed AmbassadorEikenberry and Mr. olbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to thecurrent lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.""You can't have a major shift in a civ-milstructure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,"" said a senior State Departmentofficial, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 bythe Senate on , took pains at his confirmation hearing on  to back a unified civilian and militaryeffort. e noted then that he had telephoned Mr. olbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry inBrussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.""olbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" GeneralPetraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and do have, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall toAmbassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact GeneralPetraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander inAfghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other atthe academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while AmbassadorEikenberry has master's degrees from arvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careersintersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus wascommanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, GeneralPetraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. olbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean ofthe George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. olbrooke, the newlandscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, whenhis ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, adeputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. olbrooke helped shape, while theembassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. olbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.e is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build aneconomy.These days, Mr. olbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allieswhile seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35countries in Madrid, Mr. olbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign toreintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. olbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to becomemore serious, several officials said, Mr. olbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian ofAmerican interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttlingbetween Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. olbrooke met with Mr. Karzaiand with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. olbrooke's past run-inswith Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officialssaid they trusted him. usain aqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. olbrooke took time tounderstand Pakistan's concerns. ""Ambassador olbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, evenby those who may not like him,"" Mr. aqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he haswasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last , a person familiar with the call said,General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supplymore electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. olbrooke andAmbassador Eikenberry swiftly assented."

4953,4954,2577,0,22.0,516,3,1,3,"Greetings from Nairobi. I'm at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been veryproductive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I knowthat there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach toCVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overallapproach to strategic communications around the globe.As you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. put it bluntly, we are in an ""information war"" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunitiesaround the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of ""consumer share of mind."" Both ouradversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways ofcommunicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in somecases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by ouradversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and writtenabout the concept of ""soldier diplomats"". In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of ""diplomat soldiers"" tohelp us gain ground in this new war.While countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply thesame level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive storiesabout the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions hasdiminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded toall the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in aiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field forAQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an ""invader"".Before I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much moreaggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our newregional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will workwith the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to requestthat you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilitiesin this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.Finally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, whichI think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within theMission, but across all government agencies within particular countries.I will continue to update you as we move forward.ope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC.JM"

Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energizea city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed forgood or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida tospew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open upaess to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissentand deny human rights.""And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:""On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but theUnited States does.""- Underscoring the ""this is a big deal"" tone of the speech, she enumerated the ""Four Freedoms"" that FDR proclaimed in1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for theInternet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than Iexpected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, anitemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:""In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, andUzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, aess to popular socialnetworking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last  in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists weredetained.""Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recentsense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;overtaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-deal SecState addresses by aident.Other passages to the same effect:""As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words fromthe records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,our government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should faceconsequences and international condemnation....""And then the Google section itself.I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Mainargument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a""illvineyiftaiv_in"" aeptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a helpto have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:as a proxy for China's own ability to .to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:"" use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in anenvironment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. Ifcorporate decision makers don't have aess to global sources of news and information, investors willhave less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and informationmust recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring politicalspeech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied aess to either type ofinformation, it will inevitably impact on growth.""Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greaterconsideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will payclose attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal ofinterest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions thatled Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to betransparent.""The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There areso many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free aess to information or violate thebasic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, theUnited States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differencescandidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.""There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.Back to the to-do list for me now.Peirmalink.Share This"

Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case thatallows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional politicalcampaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporationscould pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.The biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term ""corporation,"" says Edward Foley, law professor at the OhioState University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to applyto foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didn't make a decision one way orthe other.Foley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. Thecorporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, peoplecan even buy and trade Sony's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strongties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential andcongressional campaigns.The court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow ofideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in hisdissenting opinion. The majority's position ""would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporationscontrolled by foreigners as to individual Americans,"" he writes.This afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to ""develop a forceful response"" to the ruling. But with Congressjuggling so many other important issues, it's unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could meanthat foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next year's congressional midterm elections."

Even before the earthquake, there were in aiti up to 300,000 restaveks(children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants), as well asreports that members of MINUSTA used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIPport aiti was classified as a Special  country with governance so dysfunctional it couldnot be ranked.The initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food, shelter, and medicalcare, but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention isbeing paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees, TIP was not adequately addressed in theUN's initial flash appeal, so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the leadon the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead, UNFPA leads prevention of sexual andgender-based violence, and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work toremedy, in a subsequent appeal, the omission of TIP from the operational plan.We are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on ispaniola and toreprogram an additional $550,000; we will work with PRM to identify other fundingpossibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s, it is ourintention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in aiti, torebuild capacity of aitian organizations that protect restaveks, to prevent traffickers in theDominican public from enslaving displaced aitians on farms and in prostitution, and toeducate aitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We willconsult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute totrafficking. It will be important for the Department's messaging to convey our commitment tofighting human trafficking in both the immediate and long term.SENSITIVE BUT "

5006,5007,2616,0,2.0,520,3,1,3,"FYI:  one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis:Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinatedresponse. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed bya more detailed Master Plan for habilitation and construction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depthsector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances withconsiderable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR wasconsultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR waspresented on 26 , only 3 months after the Tsunami.2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The lief phase was originally set tosix months, but was then reduced to three: -  2005. The habilitation phase is to run forabout 21 months, through  2006, and the construction phase from  2006 through 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.3. The objectives for the lief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergencyinfrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The habilitation phase is to restoreservices to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; traumatreatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, construction is to rebuildthe region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, thehabilitation and construction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end 2005 and became operational early . The World Bank Board on 30  2005 formally establishedthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civilsociety. aving a credible local coordinators was key to suess.5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from theUS goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to beginwith even slower. By  2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, butonly USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delaywas caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all theexact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regardingformal agreements, and aept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution ofslightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval andimplementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to beimplemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not haveown capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assumefiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring thatthe funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank aount with some paid-for administrative services. owever, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large andto some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talkshows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements aswell as a telephone hotline.8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thusan entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.9. Because the MDF does not aept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow forpreference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming aording to thecriteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as themost suessful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has beencriticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term view conducted in 2008-2009 found that theMDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectivenessand efficiency of the reconstruction effort.10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response."

""Let'sget rid of the freeze and get back to building,"" declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein onIsrael National Radio yesterday. ""It's our land anyway!"" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the WashingtonPost's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that ""there were zero building starts in the WestBank settlements.""During the week of  21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to documentnew settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at aroma, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. er photos show ongoingconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.0Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after heannounced the freeze in  2009. e attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a falsedistinction between the West Bank and ""parts of Jerusalem"" like ar oma that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeligovernment flack Mark gev remarked in  2009, ""We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank andJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."" With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to goforward.Aording to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuringJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported,""The White ouse meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of amoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in ."" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it wasonly an illusion after all."

Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia:The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an internationalcounterterrorism center ""under the auspices of the UN."" The purpose of the organization would be to, among otherthings, ""develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States"" on a wide range of non-military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistanceto developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow nationalcounterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA),but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to beinterested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN andSaudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementationof the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and thedifferent CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and havemultilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forwardon S/CT's CFO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.Please let me know if you would like any further info.Thanks,MikeMichael .

Gelb 7, 2010 I 2:38pmI ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the OvalOffice of the White ouse,  6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow to Netanyahu wasjust the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie . Gelb on who's toblame—and how the White ouse can get back on course.Whoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experiencein dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks.And whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on  should also be fired. Theonly thing aomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy forthe rest of Obama's first term.The real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure.Were the culprits the non-foreign policy White ouse intimates — chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho DavidAxelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was GeorgeMitchell, the president's Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he's had enough experienceworking with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And ofcourse, where was Secretary of State illary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel's constituents inAmerica, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. as she been led astray by the pro-Arab contingent of the State Department?•Martin Indyk: New ope for Mideast Peace•Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more wefind out about who makes decisions in the White ouse on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Eastereggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. e's the expert. e's the decider. e invites everyone to statehis or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.Mr. Obama started his White ouse tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in theMiddle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. e came out of the box demandingthat Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.Anyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahuagreeing to this ""proposal"" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginningnegotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?And yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the oly Land by announcing theywould start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogantand stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away withit. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.Netanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeliprime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn't shake his hand when he departed. There'sno surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leaderhumiliate him.This brilliant tactic — thought of by Obama's advisers or the president himself — aomplished two things. It stiffened Israelibacks even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was notabout to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular withinconservative parts of the Jewish community and the publican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support for pressingIsrael even in private. top this all off with 's meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,only made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of. .American politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to seegenuine progress in Mideast talks.There is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time andplace. The right oasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given andwhere both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a realshot at peace in return for their concessions. be sure, many ask at this point — ow do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry tothe negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,conditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British'pushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to furtherinflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic womento form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved intobackers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, theirnegotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That's what needs to be done between Israel and thePalestinians.We hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that iswhat has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it's a race against the clock. Do something nowor fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure. Neither Israel nor thePalestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetualviolence. set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to getthings done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.Leslie .

SidBelow is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. ere's asummary:1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;4. 20% of Americans ""felt support"" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affairThe figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine thesituation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.Channel Ten TV News,  1 2010 20:38Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation inthe world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe hasobtained the report.Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from theinternational elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leadingAmerican political consultants, a publican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and todozens of the biggest corporations in the US. e was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check theopinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The resultis a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number onepropagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with ausing the international community, writes Luntz, theylose their audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected bymost of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members ofNetanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. e warns of a dangerous slide in thepublic opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change worldpublic opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to aeptarguments that support Israeli positions.Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food, there's no shortage of medicine, there's no shortage of other goods.Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and nohumanitarian crisis in Gaza. e says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on thetelevision screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasismine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis inGaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people inGaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunity,aording to Luntz.Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear.

In addition, almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war inAfghanistan is a lost cause.Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction, an even more sourassessment than in  when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters arepessimistic, while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.""They don't see any solutions in sight,"" said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. ""They have been hammered by the economy and thereis a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.""Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and publicans,with both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to vote,publicans are favored, 48 percent to 40 percent. The publican advantage is even greater amonglikely voters who view the election as exceptionally important, with publicans beating Democrats 56percent to 34 percent.Control of CongressFor the Democrats, whd control Congress and the White ouse, the survey shows the potential 'for lossesin , when voters will fill all 435 ouse seats, 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. Theoutcome could affect °Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading upto his own 2012 re-election bid.The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next fourmonths and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market couldhelp as well. So far this year, the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obamahimself, as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.Obama, 48, remains more popular than any of the publican figures tested in the poll and is topped onlyby Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Da,,,td Petraeos, the new commander of U.S. forces inAfghanistan, among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.publican LeadersThe only bright spot for publican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele!, who gets a 32percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as formervice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former ouse Speaker Netf,ri: CirigPait both have negativeratings that outweigh the positive views.Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races, the electorate isinterested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say 's election is very or exceptionallyimportant.The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters, publicans and those with the highest incomes.Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote, compared with 48 percent of thoseyounger than 35. Four-fifths of publicans say they will definitely vote, compared with 65 percent ofDemocrats and 62 percent of independents.ferendum on °barnaSeeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters, publicans want to make the election anational referendum on Obama and the party in power, while the White ouse and Democrats argue it isabout going forward, rather than backward to failed policies.The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelingsabout the economy among voters. In the poll, publicans have the advantage among the independentsoften critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote, publican congressionalcandidates are preferred to Democrats, 50 percent to 29 percent.""Anything that has been tried hasn't resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary peoplelive,"" Selzer said. ""That's a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.""Incumbent DisadvantageA third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served inCongress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending amessage, while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.""I don't know what these people are thinking in Washington,"" says poll respondent Jeff Lockman, 41, aprofessional golfer and publican from Malvern, Pennsylvania. ""They are going in 10 different directionsand they really don't know what to focus on.""The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in1994, when publicans took control of Congress, and 2006, when Democrats took over.The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority, the war in Afghanistan. While the presidenthas ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake,58 percent say it is a lost cause, compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority ofpublicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan, while 71 percent of Democrats saythe conflict is lost.Afghanistan WithdrawalSix in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in 2011, while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there, or even addingadditional forces.flecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won, a third of Americans say they have becomeless supportive of the effort there in recent months.The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1,004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentagesbased on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.:4:?,r;yr• '.3cwrra:1, who studies public opinion at the ,A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute, a public-policy researchgroup in Washington, cails the poll ""very, very grim news for the Democrats.""At the same time, she says, one silver lining for Democrats is that publicans have yet to convincevoters that they have a plan.Obarna VisitOne signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help aDemocratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama, while 20 percent say it would hurt thecandidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know.Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit, where 59 percent disapprove and 37percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5trillion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, aording to projections the White ouse released in . It was$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency, andObama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from hispublican predecessor's administration.""My biggest fear is we have people in government who don't have a clue about what is going on in theeconomy,"" says poll respondent Jim eeter, 66, from Glendale, Arizona. ""They have never run a businessor had to make a payroll.""Economy, ealth CareSlim majorities disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and health care. When it comes tocreating jobs, he gets 46 percent approval, addressing problems on Wall Street, 42 percent support,running the war in Afghanistan, 46 percent approve, and managing the BP Plc oil spill, 46 percentsupport.Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for WallStreet. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White ouse and Democrats on mostother issues.Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned toautomotive companies to help them stay in business, while 37 percent have become less supportive ofthe health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority, 61 percent, say the nationshould wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone, while 37 percent want to see itrepealed.Arizona Immigration LawAlmost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement todetain anyone who can't produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense, as is contemplated inan Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans tosue Arizona.At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to givefinancial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate whovoted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providingsuch support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.Clinton PopularityThe disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn't carry over to all Democrats. illary Clinton, 62, isviewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans, including 30 percent ofpublicans and 21 percent of Democrats, say the nation would be in a better place if she had beenelected president.The Tea Party movement, which has been mainly associated with publicans, has lukewarm support inthe poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if acandidate was backed by Tea Party activists, while a third of publicans say that kind of backing wouldmake a candidate more appealing to them.Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent ofall respondents -- include Democrats, 65 percent, and those with the highest incomes, 52 percent.Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would bebetter served by reduced federal government, compared with 39 percent overall."

SCA favorsproviding more USG support for AUCASince 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and variousother initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollarsprovided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors tothe AUCA president on areditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds forstudents from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and hisfoundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and theyhave been discussing the issue with Soros' staff.A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on anumber of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solelyon merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this yearrelated to its U.S. areditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution aredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recentlyestablished a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroomtechnology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the newAUCA president who will take office this summer.I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow.

Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of buildingmaterials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must beheld to aount. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has toprevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever theemotions behind all this.Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the oupying force forthe proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating atraumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. Theyare also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled ""Illegal, inhuman. andinsane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010"". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. ow has Israel,the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim tointernational legitimacy in its handling of this situation?amas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectlyperhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gazabombing stopped in  2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, amas security people are being sniped at by theIsraeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the WestBank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the oupation. I am convinced from my own directexperience that amas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without thethreat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish twostates in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end theblockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. amas have indicated thatthey could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza ifthe blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah inthe West Bank and amas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make amuch more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own politicalcomfort.We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, islocked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel isconfident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today'sworld, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, andlegitimacy breeds support.Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyondthe west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent oupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part ofits population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.I hope that amas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attractedmuch too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely aepted as a negotiating partner, they mustunequivocally aept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the oupation. Inwhoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.•This article was originally written for the Times but not published"

Deuel has lived in Arlington eights, but her heart has resided in JamalPlace, a three-story graystone at 1335 S. California Ave. in the North Lawndale neighborhood ofChicago. As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place, Deuel can tell countless stories aboutthe boys, ages 11 to 17, who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanitesfrom St. Charles, Naperville, Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered, donated and served on theboard to help those kids. Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and JamalPlace.But when the new fiscal year begins on  1, the Illinois Department of Children and FamilyServices will not renew its contract with Jamal Place, forcing those kids to go to other facilities."" shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable,"" says Deuel, as she takes a deepbreath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check.She and her staff operated last year through a $1,041,000 contract with DCFS to provide a grouphome for 10 wards of the state. They've carved out a wonderful reputation in 15 years, so whathappened?The easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance-based contractingsystem that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running away,requiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention.""Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve,"" says DCFS spokesmanKendall Marlowe. Jamal Place simply didn't measure up in the areas the state measures.Because Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of 52,000 in 1997 to only15,500, a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses, substance abuse or otherproblems. Since the state measures an agency's performance by days that the kids are physicallypresent in the home, Jamal Place, with its small population, got bad marks when a child washospitalized for a mental-health issue or detained by a judge.""We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it,"" says Brian Barclay,assistant executive director of Jamal Place. ""We did what was in kids' best interest.""There is no consideration given for ""incremental improvements in youth behavior, which our astrusting relationships develop,"" Deuel notes. ""I wish they could find a way to measure the individualaspects.""When compared with similar facilities, Jamal Place graded lower, Marlowe says, adding that it ""isn't ahappy day"" when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has ""good people"" and has done""good work"" in the past. e says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitionalliving facility that serves an older population.One of Jamal Place's ""unfavorable"" outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record whenhe came to the group home at age 14. Now 17, he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made amistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman's purse.""I've got a good relationship with the staff and residents. We did things as a family,"" says the teen,who now is living with a grandmother. ""I love my grandmother, but I'd rather be at Jamal Place. I'mtrying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place.""Intangibles aren't part of the bureaucratic process. There isn't a place on an evaluation form to givecredit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local ""crack house."" There's no way tomeasure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign ""love"" before hisname on the Mother's Day card he sent Deuel this year. There's no scoresheet for the local gangleader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her asthe woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier. The interview for this story isinterrupted when that man calls Deuel, who is helping him find a legitimate job.""It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is nota 'measurable' outcome,"" Deuel says. ""These are our children. Long after DCFS is done with thesekids, our door is still open.""Last weekend, many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them. On 26, Jamal Place will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Park,across the street from the home. Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them moretime, another year to continue its mission.""I've always maintained that God won't let us fail,"" says Deuel. ""For 15 years, that's been the case,and now we've got this challenge."""

This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health andwill include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and theprivate sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfillingMillennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal aess toreproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focuson maternal and child health (MC). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians areoffering a flagship initiative on MC, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in , where the UNSecretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's ealth. The US will be represented at theWomen Deliver conference by Secretary of ealth and uman Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State MariaOtero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a videomessage that will open the conference.The full script is below.SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS• For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated theissue of maternal health in our development work through the Global ealth Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal tohelp countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with aparticular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other internationalgatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in —presents a uniqueopportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families andcommunities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONALBACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is ""Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women,"" with afocus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize thefollowing messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing inwomen.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conferencein London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASINGTON, DCI am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternalhealth at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired actionaround the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potentialof women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for toolong and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remainsa leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our developmentwork through the Global ealth Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomesthrough strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. Wecommend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative onmaternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United NationsSecretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations toengage in a much-needed global effort to promote women's and children's health. These efforts—and this conference—present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, theirfamilies and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. Thank you."

Lithuaniahas the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. Itwas not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among otherreasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specificpractical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know,they have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voiceswhen you headed up the conference in Iceland and the suessor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. Wetalked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflictresolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses wherethings appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation foughtfor (they remember being a ""Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was littlelikelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too manyplaces. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address thecritical challenges.Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. e is all for our doing the gender working group assomething tangible. e is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was acreation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places, I hope we will find a way towork with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevanttoday. They are planning the first ministerial in Krakow in  and hoping so much that you will be a part of it.Assuming I can get there, I'm going to their embassy in the morning where several government reps of participatingcountries will be meeting to announce next steps, including the gender working group."

5216,5217,2755,0,15.0,401,3,1,3,"Just FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right ""magazines"" - notes that the home you referenced in your PrayerBreakfast remarks has since closed.I checked in with Lissa & Melanne, they didn't know it closed, which makes sense since it happened in 2002 after you leftthe White ouse.I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue - throughout your public career - is well known, and youremain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in 1995. And that your partnership is asuess story to be emulated.Again, this is just FYIhttp://www.worldmag.com/webextra/16398ADOPTION I illary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has sinceclosed its doors By Emily BelzWASINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State illary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with MotherTeresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National PrayerBreakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last  Clintondescribed Mother Teresa ""beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,"" seemingly oblivious that theMother Teresa ome for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelesslyto ""cut through all the red tape,"" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. Aording to apastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because theRoman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. ""I'm not sure thelegal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,"" saidMaureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshourhas stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remainingthree or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.""This hasbeen a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,"" said Chuck Johnson, chiefoperating officer of the National Council for Adoption. ""It's an issue she's been consistent on.""During her speech on, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and MotherTeresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country thataepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa thencalled on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me thechild.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did notstand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with illary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had ashared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babieshere in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa ome forInfant Children opened in  1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnantmothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charityin Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone saidshe couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters whoare in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. Sheadded that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work therebecause it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those withAIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.###"

The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashedstreets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight thathas not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the mostexciting for a generation - had never ended.But this is a campaign without a vote. day, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, notSouth ampton, New ampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White ouse, despite whatthe overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule mightsuggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea ofUS leadership, one very much built around herself.She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the halltonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raisedarms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delaysthat pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels whileBrazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of aborn politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers andlocal celebrities for an hour. illary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for itto be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armedbodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than aquarter of a million miles since taking office.On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited fourcountries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for ashower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where wedon't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime ministeror the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in herexpansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and avote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind ofleadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.""She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. er aides say that, as abattle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she isideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing theforeign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -go beyond that.Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies,toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values andfor American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges wehad to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.""As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks acough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is stillhectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the StateDepartment are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable andunhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues ofstate. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she'sbeen talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.""e said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know howelse to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word""chunky"".Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message mannerof her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - knownless for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman whoretains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurryingfrom a room.er staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George .W.Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the mostsubstantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate whoserved as secretary almost a century ago. ""er stature on the world stage, her almost presidentialstature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaderswant to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""State visitor illary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Pauloairport in Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae oftraditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about herdance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervousyoung man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another femalestudent asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as sheemphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as ifdemonstrating the size of a fish.Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves intotreacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not justexpectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy womenhave rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" er strength of feeling can't be hiddenas she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercisesuch a fundamental personal right"".m Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that wemight have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She wassharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clintondoesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial withoutappearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straightahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it isthe lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting thepodium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear hersatisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left thestage.Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""towards Obama. er mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing theforeign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positivediscrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-Brazilians aount for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students sothat they can have a chance to sueed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, beforespeaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. Shesays: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest aomplishment of all because itdemonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsomestatement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll leadand millions of dollars in the struggle against him.The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the ObamaadministrationWhen I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to theobedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We'reworking really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history tome."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always runinclusive and suessful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons fromthat searing experience to her new post.She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed theSenate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to dosomething, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had wonand I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clintonhas moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force thanbefore. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognisedthat,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship isbased on her performance in the job.""By all aounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a goodworking relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of analliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it isGates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either beenpopular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran'svolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than heis to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says KurtVolker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu ofIsrael and amid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aidessay they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes BillClinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is akind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlinesbut the trend lines.""It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is thechief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifyingand solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidableare the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights butneeds instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be asmart decision - by all aounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White ouse retinue hadtowards her.""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for themost consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what hecalls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount ofwork, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. Shehas dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At herconfirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at themeeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. Sheherself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite hercampaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms aroundall of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including theway she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on oupied territory only to hail a partial freezea few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different cityfour times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at youraudience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or globalchallenges in the course of a day.""As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array ofinternational issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number ofimportant countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. Shesays the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about theUS"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran andover Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amidquestioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given thecountry's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push tosecure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to hercause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreignminister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs toBrazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people toavoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctionson Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agreewith everything the Secretary said,"" he says.It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at theUnited Nations - yet illary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographersdescribed his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife'spreferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws inher cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after thefrustrations and indignities of her time at the White ouse. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in thearena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening tocoverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and shegets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history thatyou bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa RicaInjustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her manyother incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in notjust the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities andthe tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. day, shesays, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to domy job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe ines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and issitting to one side in her office.""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further bytalking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade.  what end? Clinton has said she willonly serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When Iask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""Ithink that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned womenwho are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart torun for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one USofficial, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished withelectoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already illary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the ideabehind raising her domestic profile still further?""Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington sayshe could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. Thejourney goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hardroad. day the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are ratherfewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, illary Clinton,long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondentDavid Miliband: ""illary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because illary Clinton, and the Obama administration, islaying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership isessential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different andoverlapping forums - is real and right.You also have to remember that illary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministersmeeting in  2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to haveturned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that illary was 10 minutes behind me.That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or herhard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a greatsense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herselfas well as at others.She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinksstrategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. illary is a very political person but ina particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not anecessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it'sessential to take part.There's one other thing. illary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of thepeople she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence intrying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be whyso many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.David Miliband is shadow foreign secretaryGideon Rachman: ""lations between the White ouse and the State Department are not particularlyclose""A school teacher asked to write a report on illary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to giveher 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endlessbureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been inpromoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Suess in one area usually helps in the other. enryKissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made himall the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widelyadmired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, whichlimited his ability to get things done in the wider world.illary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that sodamaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during thecampaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between theWhite ouse and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clintonappointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State israther detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreigncapitals such as Cairo, Prague, kyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more thananyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives havebeen appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips andsays: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular areawhere she has really driven policy.""Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnistDavid Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""illary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursuedhis agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well withother members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the riseof new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policystructure aordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating withprivate and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be themost powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of thesituation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremelydifficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise ofemerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options toone where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have towork in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All ofthose things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.illary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signatureissues - and have a couple of signature suesses. That will take her to the next level.David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise innational security"

""Did you say: Bite me?""Another aide called White ouse National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a retired four star general, a ""clown"" who was ""stuck in 1985.""It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a ""10-minute photo op.""""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed,"" the adviser told the magazine.McChrystal, a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day, was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessorwas pushed out.The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration, with the exception of Secretary of State illary Clinton,who backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard olbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.""The boss says he's like a wounded animal,"" a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. ""olbrooke keeps hearing rumorsthat he's going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous.""McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan KarlEikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking incredibility.""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before,"" McChrystal was quoted as saying in thearticle.""ere's one that covers his flank for the history books.

Stanley McChrystal, the overall commander in Afghanistan, that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on .In the eight-page article, released to reporters on  ahead of publication, McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and auses Karl Eikenberry, the U.S.ambassador to Kabul, of undermining his war plan within the administration.Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall — fewer troops, more drone attacks — the article reports thatMcChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. ""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal reportedly jokes. ""Who'sthat?""Later in the article, McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increaseadvocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President amid Karzai — views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff.""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before,"" McChrystal is quoted as saying. ""ere's one that covers his flank for the historybooks. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.""The article, titled ""The Runaway General,"" has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon, where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a topcommander in hot water: an  2008 cover story in Esquire  on Adm. William ""Fox"" Fallon, then commander of all U.S.forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago.In that Esquire piece, however, Fallon appeared to directly contradict White ouse policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no suchallegation, but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players.Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration, including National SecurityAdviser James Jones, and other leading politicians, like Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and John McCain (R., Ariz). They also make some unflattering references toPresidentBarack Obama himself, saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year.Only Secretary of State illary Clinton, who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan, is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystalaides.A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late .Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Now if we fail, they can say, ?I told you so.""Eikenberry, himself a former commander in Afghanisan, had written to the White ouse saying Afghan President amid Karzai was an unreliable partnerand that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire.The article revisits the friction between the White ouse and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens ofthousands of reinforcements.Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for, the strategy review was a difficult time, the general tells the magazine.""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal says. ""I was selling an unsellable position.""An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago, just after thepresident named him to take over in Afghanistan.""It was a 10-minute photo op,"" the general's adviser says.""Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him, who he was.., he didn?t seem very engaged.""The boss was pretty disappointed,"" says the adviser.The profile, titled ""The Runaway General,"" portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal, while arguing the general has seized control overthe war on the military and diplomatic fronts.The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region, Richard olbrooke, and complains about a dinner with an unnamed Frenchminister during a visit to Paris.""Oh, not another e-mail from olbrooke,"" McChrystal says, looking at his messages on a mobile phone. ""I don't even want to open it.""In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official, McChrystal says: ""ow'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?""""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his aide, Colonel Charlie Flynn.""ey, Charlie,"" McChrystal says, ""does this come with the position?""McChrystal gives him the middle finger.Copyright © 2010 AFP.

Friendsand co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. e mightleave in  after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending onwhether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.And even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots inD.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School inWashington through the 2011 school year, aording to a person close to Emanuel.e's shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White ousestaffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as hetraveled in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah.And in a broader sense, it's hard to imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted fromthe political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama's Washington.Take the last game of last week's NBA Finals, when any American voter could wanderinto Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol ill and witness one of the most powerful men in thenation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joinedby a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader arry id (D-Nev.); and a pair offavorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.Despite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama's ""idealism"" and isracing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairmanstill loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn't made up his mind whenhe's leaving, people who know him said.""This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless,"" Emanuel said in a statementpushing back against a story in the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless!and fed up.placing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and thesmall clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.For one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post- politicallandscape looks like before picking a suessor: If publicans take back one or morehouse of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executivepower against a hostile ill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel's suessor willneed some of his legislative skills.Barring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn't likely toreach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.Still, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quitelikely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenWhead of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a majorliberal think tank with close ties to the administration.Rouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama's Senate chief of staff, is considered thebest pure manager in the White ouse and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, aordingto a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants.But Rouse's colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Deadand his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unlessObama insisted.""The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, verycomfortable with him in charge,"" said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.""But he probably won't take it.""One possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy— is likely to play a major role in Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and is expected tomove to Chicago sometime next year.In Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser mDonilon — has emerged as a possible suessor, aording to people close to thesituation.Obama has been impressed by Donilon's presentations at the President's Daily Briefing,and the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,serving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Departmentspokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obamaprepare for debates against John McCain.One major Donilon drawback: e served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,the bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatoryoversight.David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputationfor discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant tosettle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.Former Senate Majority Leader m Daschle is also a possible suessor, even thoughhis nomination for ealth and uman Services secretary was scuttled by revelations hefailed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.Another White ouse aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama's for his legislative savvyand political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experiencethat other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the ill won't mean much ifDemocrats surrender their majorities in either house.Then there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy and politically astute chiefof staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the EisenhowerExecutive Office Building to the West Wing.Klain — who also served as Al Gore's chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the Whiteouse. Plus, he's got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the BO movie""count,"" about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.Klain's downside: e's essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapportwith the president, aording to insiders.C 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC"
5276,5277,2795,13,7.0,551,3,1,3,"http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/06/the-israeli-medias-flotilla-fail/The Israeli Media's Flotilla FailOn 06.22.10, By Max BlumenthalMy summaty of the Israeli media's shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here inebrew at Dvorit Shargal's excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated anequally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned out one misleading claimafter another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public's mind a version of events thatbore little relation to reality.  a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel's mostrespected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF's rapidly changing versions ofevents. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, andtheir terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independentreporters forced the IDF to retract or ""clarify"" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, orcovered them up without acknowledgment.It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to dosomething which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it's supposed to be applied routinely:Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judgingfrom Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did theirjob for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.On  2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, ""Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaedamercenaries."" The ausation was not aompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmarapassengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, who wasembedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an ""interrogation"" of Marmarapassengers — ""lynchers,"" he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, ""Some among the [flotilla passengers] arebelieved to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda."" The article made no reference to any efforts on part ofBen Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerousoperatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn't they? •On  3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the al News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman's Officeto demand further evidence of the Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from theIDF's Israel and North America desks: ""We don't have any evidence. The press release was based on information fromthe National Security Council."" ours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, ""Attackersof IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers."" Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remainsuncorrected.On  4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Navalwarship. ""Go back to Aushwitz!"" a Marmara passenger shouted, aording to the IDF. YNet and aaretz reported on andreproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur soundedlike a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, theywould have found a longer clip released on  31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara withno mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer uwaida Arraf was featured in the ""Aushwitz"" clip, yet Arrafwas not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit publichysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, theIDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a ""clarification"" and a new clip claiming to consist of the""full"" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and aaretz have not corrected their original reports, though aaretz has at leastaltered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directinginternational attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial presscorps.On  7, aaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotillapassengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including thatKen O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with ny Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a amas commando unitin the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available tosupport their press release. ""There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,"" Sgt. Chen Arad told me.""Obviously I'm unable to give you more information."" Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered inthe same manner as I did, why did aaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?Joined by aaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos arel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytimedeception by the IDF. On  31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Navalcommandos — the flotilla passengers' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynchingattempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to supporteither ausation. The article was aompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman's Office depicting abearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behindthe man. aaretz's caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken ""after"" the commandos hadboarded the Marmara. owever, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Onceagain, the IDF's story was fishy.I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman's Office to investigate. e told me he had no evidence to support the photo'squestionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, aaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that thephoto was taken ""after"" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why didaaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman'sOffice. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country's media.In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media's investigation into thebloodbath that ourred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better aess to the military or theeyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscriptedinto the IDF's hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters whoremembered to view claims by any nation's military with extreme skepticism.So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claimsare retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandontheir duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and aess toinformation? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as avital source of information, need to know."

Stanley McChrystal. It's a  night in mid-,and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the Otel Westminster inParis. e's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actuallyhave allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the UnitedStates. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's presidentand sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris tokeep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.""ey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?""McChrystal gives him the middle finger.The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operationscenter. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic ughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civiliancasual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of hisadvisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting anyplace with candles on the tables as too ""Gui."" e prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, TalladegaNights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal feltcomfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running thePentagon's most secretive black ops.""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive carbombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says.McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale inscue Dawn. is slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up ordisappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says.e pauses a beat.""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it.""With that, he's out the door.""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides.""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay.""The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a Frenchmilitary academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comeswith a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to pissoff almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech hegave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the presidenthimself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystalseemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profileNow, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might gettoday, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says.Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-liner.""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?""""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?""When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaignpromise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want theAmerican people to understand,"" he announced in  2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantleand defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" e ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase sincethe war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. DavidMcKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and hadmet only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime inmore than 50 years, since arry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. Thegeneral first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officialsin a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. Aording to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obamalooked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in theOval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minutephoto op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. ere's the guywho's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."" the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for acontroversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of thePentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands offighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy theenemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — aprocess that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentiallyrebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solutionfor Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terroristsin Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.After arriving in Afghanistan last , the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense SecretaryRobert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure.""The White ouse was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weakon national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon wasdetermined to kick the president's ass.Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy inAfghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling anunsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him againstexperienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign inAfghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entireCOIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leadingcritic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trilliondollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On  1st, in a speech at West Point, thepresident laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economiccrisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troopsto Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,behind the counterinsurgency crowd.day, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of suess look bleak.In , the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billionsof dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive thatbegan in  to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to itas a ""bleeding ulcer."" In , Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — andObama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in  of next year. Thepresident finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, eventhough it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said hedidn't want.Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages toaomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smelllike a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill ville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is goingto end in an argument.""The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,around the corner from the hotel. is wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, shehas seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal hasinvited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gui"" place his staff could find. is wife isn't surprised.""e once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh.The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, twofighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves asTeam America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselveson their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set aboutchanging the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers hadtaken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol onbase, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousandsof officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hubmodeled after or Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. e also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendaryfor sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spendaround the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, astaple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a mansingle-handedly winning the war.By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with stepsfrom a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their owninvention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song.McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd diefor me.""The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit grouprepresents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputablecommand of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, anassortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Specialpresentative to Afghanistan Richard olbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State illaryClinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves intothe mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to callthe shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,""says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign lations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannotby itself create governance reform.""Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the StateDepartment receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shitabout many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general andveteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the  talkshows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only illary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""illaryhad Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'""McChrystal reserves special skepticism for olbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss sayshe's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""olbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going toget fired, so that makes him dangerous. e's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasponto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.""At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from olbrooke,"" he groans. ""Idon't even want to open it."" e clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back inhis pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.Aording to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. e's also furious that McChrystal, backed byNATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him thediplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectivelyincreased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filledby an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.The relationship was further strained in , when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The NewYork Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal'sstrategy, dismissed President amid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether thecounterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with noway to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness andchaos.""McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never saidanything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""ere's one that covers hisflank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'""The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, notdiplomats like Eikenberry or olbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to leadAfghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not consideredcredible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has aompaniedthe president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.In , the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to gethim to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that thepresident was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlistedthe aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible governmentputs us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in hiscable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""e's been locked up in hispalace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively underminedMcChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter ed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we werefighting in Uruzgan!""Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow himthroughout his career. is father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers alljoined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which hemade no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping afastball down the middle.McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. is class was thelast to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the udson,"" as it was known then, was apotent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow ormud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on toserve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.forces in Iraq.The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how tothrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. e aumulated morethan 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower afterdowning a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hourssubjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'dend up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystalin 1973.McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded asbrilliant. is most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literarymagazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in hiscareer. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narratorappears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is theassassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White ouse: ""The President strode in smiling.  the right coat pocket of theraincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had sueeded.""After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We reallyfelt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.""So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: e enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimentalcommander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozenRangers were killed in training aidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers whowant to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considersoutdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. e introduced mixed martial arts,required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurancewith weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at arvard's Kennedy School ofGovernment and then at the Council on Foreign lations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacksof humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned asa troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without gettingtossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos thatfollowed  11th. ""e was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what hewanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.""By some aounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesmanduring the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White ouse mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commanderwith a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens""remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's MissionAomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took partin a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was aidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in 2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. esigned off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commanderknown for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances ofCorporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president.""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother,Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""goldenboy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skippingthe chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama inIraq. Aording to a report by uman Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany ofabuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, eventhough an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was sounsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command inAfghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" aording to a U.S. official. In  2009, as McChrystal prepared forhis confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But thescandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war inAfghanistan.The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of adweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek calledhim. e didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. e speaks his mind with a candorrare for a high-ranking official. e asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. e gets briefings onhis iPod and listens to books on tape. e carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his nameand four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus,and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") e went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fuckinglads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someonewould take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.""It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely suessful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the eliteforces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands ofinsurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen.ville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. e systematically mapped out terroristnetworks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunnedby the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystalin Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""e'd say, 'ey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.You got to work together with these guys.'""Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instinctsof a terrorist hunter.  put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan fromfour to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in thehallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the generalfrequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of thisyear, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has createdtremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In , a SpecialForces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in , protestserupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces aidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number ofpeople,"" McChrystal recently conceded.Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties thatthe U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math,"" as he calls it — for every innocent person youkill, you create 10 new enemies. e has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of airpower and severely limited night raids. e regularly apologizes to amid Karzai when civilians are killed, and beratescommanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while,"" says one U.S. official, ""the most dangerous place to be inAfghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to makenot killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint,"" abuzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his owntroops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former SpecialForces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. is rules ofengagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""In , McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confrontsuch ausations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he hadreceived an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.""I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,"" Arroyowrote.Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the ausation that I don't care about soldiers, as it issomething I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions dependupon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo'soutpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real liveoperation in a dangerous war zone.Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IEDa day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the generalwould attend Ingram's memorial service. ""e started to look up to you,"" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try tomake it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFMto speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guardtowers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seensome of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. is commanders hadrepeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as acombat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had beendenied. ""These were abandoned houses,"" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith icks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonablycertain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,"" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who hastraveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won'thave to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fuckingbomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain ofcommand — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck, when I came over here andheard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,"" says icks, who has served three toursof combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on hisbird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either becausesomebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing thisthing.""McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some twodozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all tounderstand the big picture as well,"" McChrystal begins. ""ow's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry foryourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.""Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,"" says icks.McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,"" he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking aboutcounterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. e makes COIN seem like common sense,but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year,"" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, nolonger has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do, either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning anyhearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,"" McChrystal tries to joke.""But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to uselethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like theydid in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,"" one soldier says.""Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,"" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can'tkill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.""""I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,"" the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of theinsurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it'sgetting.""""I agree with you,"" McChrystal says. ""In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population outhere and resettle it?""A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be acivilian. ""That's the way this game is,"" McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll killall the shirts.""As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't sueeded at easing the men's anger. e makes onelast-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier,"" he tellsthem. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have soldPresident Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any suess herewas Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recentmemory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,"" he says. But even if he somehow manages tosueed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little toshut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by oupyingArkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical, politically,"" says Marc Sageman, a former CIAcase officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for usthere.""In mid-, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White ouse for a high-level visit byamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both inKabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings thepraises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civiliancasualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is nodenying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economicdevelopment,"" the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have beenvisible just a few years earlier.""It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had noreal progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of suess. ""It was one of our firstimpressions,"" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So manylights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk ofprogress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would havemocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not evendefined or recognizable,"" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a politicaladviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, isto create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to becomegreat in the near future.""But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even thoseclosest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up thingsare in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,""a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency fromdreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up itscounterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces nextsummer if we see suess here,"" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White ouse meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress,""McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planningto launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's originalhome base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge thatMcChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on  10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay moregroundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, likeFallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police andarmy will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the cityto win over the civilian population.Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation,"" says aU.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black awk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officialsinsist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.""The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,"" says a military official. ""We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a waythat doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiderssay he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.""This looks like CT-plus!"" he said, aording to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine yearsof war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people thatCOIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used hisinfluence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make thingsworse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,"" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University whohas studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the governmentand creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostilityamong the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has sueeded only in creating a never-ending demand for theprimary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids usingthe word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even withStanley McChrystal in charge.This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from  8-22, 2010."

The American players roared with pride as the formerpresident (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: ""I'm proud of youbecause you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!""Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem tobelieve they had done it.The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them witha beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarsevoice.As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the playerschased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members ofTeam USA.Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens.""If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,"" he said. ""It was a great game. Youknow, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have goodheads and good hearts."""

Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore'scharacteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context, as well as a lively human sympathyfor the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewinghim at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia asthe growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were thensuggesting. ""No it doesn't,"" Yeo told me. ""At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years."" It moved thegraph a little to the right, it didn't change the trends. On that, Yeo was absolutely right.But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.This week, Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historicaltour de force conversations in which he specialises.It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-PacificCommunity. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal withstrategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thoughtthat the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether theregion was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to aomplish. ""We still need a lot more discussion,"" he said.""The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. Theconfiguration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that's the reality we've got to workwith.We need a regional architecture which is able to aommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship isbetween the US and China. Increasingly, the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I thinkeventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangleconsisting of the US, China and India.""Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being inharmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: ""When Prime Minister Ruddproposed the APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round the region. e did not visit all countries. e made it quiteplain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon theconclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region."" PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this, that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was hisvision from the very beginning. I said, 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'.""Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) atoyama articulating his view of an East Asian regionapparently centred on China, Japan and Korea. It created, as you would expect, a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. Thatgot us all thinking in the region. ow to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that's comfortable. For a long timewe've been thinking about China, more recently about India."" Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations alsoevolved slowly, in particular the East Asia Summit, which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN, China,Japan, South Korea and India. e said: ""It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be basedon the ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir(Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. ""Others felt that's too limiting. If it's just ASEAN plus three, that may be a little lop-sidedbecause of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side, and Australia and NewZealand to the south, there's a certain natural equipoise.""Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is tooimportant a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not aommodate them in the EAS atthat time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS mightexclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing becauseAustralia and New Zealand were in it. In any case, countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive.What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.""So where do we end up today? ""When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. Sonow there are two possibilities, either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (includingthe US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the endhe's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion.""So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody is going to call it theAsia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder, as everyone aepts that Bob awkefounded APEC in 1989. On the other hand, it does seem as though it's very much more than likely that there will finallybe a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India, which is able to discuss security. That is prettymuch Rudd's policy aim and, as Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd candescribe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. is enemies can say the APC came to nothingand was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give thesmallest sampling of Yeo's prodigiously rich insights on other issues.On the US, he said: ""Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for manydecades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas, always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We inSingapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.""On China, I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power, financial and military, soit could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing'spreoupations were internal, and said: ""China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, ong Kong, Indiaand already No 2 for New Zealand, and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.""(The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoismdeveloped as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. It's now 40 per cent urban and will goto 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison, but look at Dickens or Victor ugo.Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China it's all compressed. If they sueedthey will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought themto power won't keep them in power.""e recalled that early in China's economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore, as a mostlyChinese nation, ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner, combining rapid economic growth with socialorder and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again inlarge numbers, fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and boomingcity. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians' electoral clinics in Singapore, observing how real problems arerecognised, integrated into the system and dealt with.I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. ereplied: ""Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely, reconfiguring the pieces is-difficult. A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart.""The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart, the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from thebureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with afury and intensity that surprises everyone."" Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the Meijistoration of the 19th century, in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after WorldWar II, in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region. The fact that it is nowgrappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a suessful model.Yeo is an old, old friend of Australia, and in a sense a long-term champion of Australia's involvement in Southeast Asia.e has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years. e embodies a great deal of institutionalmemory and strategic continuity, not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region.It's just a pity he doesn't visit us a bit more often."

Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International MonetaryFund, is the co-author of ""13 Bankers.""The Greek ""rescue"" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedentedand far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded bythe International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They haveabandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This newprogram calls for ""fiscal adjustments"" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent ofgross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratiopeaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honestenough to show why it is unlikely to sueed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand couldbe well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates thatGreece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad theeconomy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then byanother 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremelyoptimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed towardGreece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greeceneeds to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the endof 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., withG.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficitof around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an""upside scenario.""The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreigndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to paythe Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their ""new normal.""Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was atrisk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investorswill run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture publishedrecently in The New York Times. igher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bankruns in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a ""run,"" it is not clear where itstops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeansdecided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a smallchance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — andenormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with adebt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek""restructuring,"" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greekspay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? Itall becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended andat what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making underpressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so itsgovernment bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likelynot hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that wouldproduce:-Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.-As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-termfinancing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solventby buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.•At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That willinclude Greece and perhaps also Portugal. opefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.•European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massivefailure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executiveshave not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse. the extent possible, some of theensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for areason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care."

5413,5414,1059,0,15.0,517,3,1,3,"p 2 Civilians Face Rockiness in Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu,  1, 2010WASINGTON — As General David . Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials inthe war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of animpatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. olbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, theambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least one senior White ouse official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for ahousecleaning, aording to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that reliesheavily on civilian support, these people said.In recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might bereplaced byRyan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeusduring the suessful Iraq troop increase.Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post atTexas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront AmbassadorEikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should worktogether in war.It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting himup as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between Presidentamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Prior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White ouse had created a problem by recruiting severalforceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officialsacknowledge that, as one said, ""There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the Whiteouse believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent.Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of Stateillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. olbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team,two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look ateverything,"" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.BeGeneral Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on , took pains at his confirmationhearing on  to back a unified civilian and military effort. e noted then that he had telephoned Mr. olbrookeand would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.""olbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" General Petraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and dohave, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops toAfghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the truearchitect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated fromWest Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two sharea scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master's degreesfromarvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessmentof Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When GeneralEikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. olbrooke turned downrequests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did notreturn a call for comment.For Mr. olbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than itwas six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a lesscentral player:Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. olbrooke helpedshape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. olbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, hisown allies admit. e is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helpingAfghanistan build an economy.These days, Mr. olbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seekingto draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries inMadrid, Mr. olbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrateTaliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr.olbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. olbrooke'snegotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence ofGeneral Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad.On his last visit to the region, Mr. olbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the armychief of staff,Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. olbrooke's past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability todeal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him.usain aqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. olbrooke took time to understand Pakistan'sconcerns. ""Ambassador olbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who maynot like him,"" Mr. aqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a securevideoconference call last , a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind acostly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Talibanstronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. olbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented."

The destruction was part ofa larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indianreservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewishsettlers, including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after apeace treaty is signed. For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase themfrom the map by establishing ""facts on the ground"" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib'sdemolition here).Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge onfurniture taken from a family's home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News.One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riotpolice who stormed the village were aompanied by ""busloads of cheering civilians."" Who were these civilians and whydidn't CNN or any outlet investigate further?I traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewishstruggle against the oupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village's traumatizedchildren, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolishedhomes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib's residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about theidentity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated thedemolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen 'elders ofthe village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I hadima. med.Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib familyArab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. Theydepicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into thevillagers' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteerssmashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they loungedaround on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, aording to Matyam, the volunteerscelebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.""What we learned from the summer camp of destruction,"" Madyam remarked, ""is that Israeli youth are not being educatedon democracy, they are being raised on racism."" (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam's Arab Negev News features aphoto of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. Theheadline reads, ""Nakba 2010."")0Aording to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the villageThe Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli policevolunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state's militaryapparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib tookfrom their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach'adulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat theArab outclass as less than human. The volunteers' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyallyin Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth inebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinctionbetween the two cases, it is that the ebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalizeArab property as agents of the state.The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students donot believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, thewidespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel's authoritarian trend. Itwould be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garbencoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values.Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move inAs for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizensagainst one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionistfounding father Chaim Weizmann, ""obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path."" istorically, only failing stateshave encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolishedhomes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than thedestruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste0...and the destruction begins"

""You know what you'll see happening?Nothing.""'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'""Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.""It's unconscionable,"" Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. ""The obstructionism has becomemindless.""The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directlybehind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a  afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket andtop, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.""Also, it's a dumb rule in itself,"" McCaskill said. ""It's time we started looking at some of these rules.""She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees andsubcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill hadscheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a generaland an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill'sSubcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the omeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghanpolice. But this was  24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victoryceremony at the White ouse; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-carereform, approved by the ouse three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassingsweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. publicans, who had fought thebill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator RichardBurr, publican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. ""I have no personal objection tocontinuing,"" Burr said. But, he added, ""there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object.""Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only publican in the chamber when Levin spoke. Ingeneral, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might bepresent aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their firstlook at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. Thepresiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them tothe ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about theSenate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, ""Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch thefloor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they'redoing in China right now?""Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name everyfew minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the presslounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interestactually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On thisafternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcriptionmachines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is anintimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had tohover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, somebuilt as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majorityand Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,""Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and notbe distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule.""The publicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; thegeneral and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators thesedays direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-termsuesses while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-threeamendments pending, all from publicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on anamendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch theamendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was tofinish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the onlything worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where fortyminutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about toyield to a frenzy. arry id, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, ""This is the first time in recent memorythat a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill thereconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated.""Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New ampshire, the bill's publican manager, took the floor. ""The position on the other sideof the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good,"" he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rosehalf an octave. ""Obviously, they presume the publican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is aninconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are aninconvenience.""The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowdedDemocratic side, and the desks of the much smaller publican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant toemphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides thechamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the thirdperson, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at themoment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's ""Manual ofParliamentary Practice""—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insultingany senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at AlFranken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: ""Mr. President, make no mistake, the intentof every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator onthe other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-carereform!""The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: ""The time of the senator has expired.""For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happenson the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The publican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democratswhile appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn'thave to return to the ouse, where it might be voted down. Several of the publican amendments had been designed tomake Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. Oneamendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making lessthan two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, aLouisiana publican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator m Coburn, a publicanobstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not bedenied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent ""convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders"" frombuying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagraamendment without cracking a smile. ""This is not a game amendment,"" he insisted. ""It actually saves money.""So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.""The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,"" Baucus declared. ""It is a crasspolitical stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy."" Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and aclerk called the roll at a ragged pace. ""Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins."" Thirty-five-second pause. ""Mr. Conrad, Mr.Corker."" Ten seconds. ""Mr. Cornyn."" Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they'reso inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleaguesmilling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catchthe eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, ofNebraska—joined the publicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled dronewas that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, ""Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"" Sporadically, asharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for publicans he could charm intolaughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin ashambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set ofbehaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on acolleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (RussFeingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (DickDurbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going throughher mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the publicans were proposing a fresh batch. ""Can weget some order?"" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. Itwas the only amendment that any publicans joined the Democrats to defeat.arry id controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuousnegotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; id, a former boxer, washunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamberto confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarilyeased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside m Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if castingher Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, ""The longest it lasted was thirty seconds.""At two-forty-five in the morning, id suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just foundtwo small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill wouldgo back to the ouse for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol'snortheast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting forsomeone to take him away.The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and theDemocrats were giddy. m arkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. ""Everyone'stired,"" id declared before the final vote. ""This legislative fight is one for the record books."" e was so fatigued that heinitially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. ""Way to go, Lindsey, way tostretch it out,"" Sam Brownback told him. A few publicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losingteam at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment thechamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.The Senate is often referred to as ""the world's greatest deliberative body."" Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat fromOregon, said, ""That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms ofexchange of ideas, is so limited."" Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between apublican and a Democrat. ""The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation ourring inwhich they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber.""m Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.""You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,"" he said.Instead, a senator typically gives ""a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy getsup and gives a speech on a completely different subject.""  time to time, senators of the same party carry on acolloquy—""I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantageplan""—that has been scripted in advance by aides.While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visitsfrom lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the samemorning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearingcan barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwrittenrule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for s or s, which allows senators to spendfour days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in theirhome states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, andto the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the ouse, in 1995, hetold new publican members not to move their families to the capital.) m Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,""When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators therewas  afternoon.""Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. m arkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, ""Of any free timeyou have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more,"" is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their owncampaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power our, during which they make obligatory calls onbehalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senateoffice buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennesseepublican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, ""It sucks up time that asenator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues.""In , 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took timeto meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a milliondollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, aording to Common Cause, industry groupswere spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raisingand lobbying, said, ""People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all billsare not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.""Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: ""Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, yourstaff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a novote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, ifyou're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, becauseI don't have a clue.""Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past fewdecades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend topush senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiatingthe details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. ""You know about allthese rags that cover the ill, right?"" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The ill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,and CQ day—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect ofthe ""24/7 media,"" provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a ""dust-up"" between ScottBrown, the freshman Massachusetts publican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on theSenate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a youngpress aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of politicalobsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreportedbecause their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in1981 and will leave next , told me, ""I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on adaily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see methrough the prism of conflict."" Lamar Alexander described the effect as ""this instant radicalizing of positions to the left andthe right.""Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearlyfifty—who come from the ouse, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is stillpermissible. ""A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution,"" Gregg said. ""Substantive,thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside.""Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunchto the Power our to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know oneanother—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouseswho live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because JillCooper Udall and oney Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall hasset foot in the house of a publican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in theseventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: ""In those days Democrats andpublicans actually enjoyed each other's company."") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, JimDeMint, Dodd said, ""Not at all. Whereas Jesse elms and I knew each other pretty well."" e repeated something that JonKyl, the publican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: ""There's no trust."" Dodd, whose father was a senator,went on, ""That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with thatconclusion. And if that's missing.There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as""friends."" Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as ""one of my best friends in the Senate,"" andboth Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on withDemocrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udallnoted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities tobond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the ""inner sanctum,"" wherepublicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bullssuch as James Eastland, ubert umphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. ""Youlearned, and also you found out what was going on,"" Dodd said, adding, ""It's awfully difficult to say crappy things aboutsomeone that you just had lunch with."" These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in theirrespective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else ""downtown,"" which means asking donors for money oversteak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the ""caucus lunch"" was instituted by publicans inthe fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches workmembers on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent publican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to arryid as an idiot. ""At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"" Alexander joked, adding, ""We spend most ofour time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other.""In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan  breakfasts. ""They kind of dwindled off during thehealth-care debate,"" Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the  inner-sanctum lunch. For the first fewmonths, only Democrats attended. Then, one  in , Susan Collins, the Maine publican, showed up,joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of loverswho try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, ofWisconsin, put it this way: ""Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?""The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the ouse and the popular will.For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against alevelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de cqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeplyimpressed by the quality of its members: ""They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instinctsanimating it, not the petty passions."" But he also recognized that ""a minority of the nation dominating the Senate couldcompletely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit ofconstitutional government."" As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,cqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.Robert A. Caro, in ""Master of the Senate,"" the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, enryClay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies ofWoodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racistsand publican corporate shills, and was ""the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government."" By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative thanthe public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book ""Citadel,"" called the Senate ""to a most peculiardegree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"" and ""the only place in thecountry where the South did not lose the war.""By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film ""Advise andConsent,"" based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats andpublicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, inits way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab oneanother in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on  nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide arry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's ""famous 'club' atmosphere isbased on the members' mutual aeptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hardat one another in debate over serious matters,"" but, he writes, ""understanding and aommodation in the ordinary courseof the Senate day was essential to sanity."" Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to hiswill and forced it to become more efficient. e saw his colleagues as either ""whales""—the heavyweight chairmen whonegotiated legislation—or ""minnows,"" the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, aformidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philipart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of ""The Fall of the ouse ofRoosevelt,"" worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. ""They used to talk to each other—that's my mostvivid recollection,"" he said. ""If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in tohear him. The same with ubert umphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically."" Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, socialwelfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. ""But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanismby which you could do it,"" Janeway said.In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats andmoderate publicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate ofthose decades as ""a bipartisan liberal institution."" The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of thepublican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filedjointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,in 1965, it won 70-24.The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, enry Jackson, Frank Church,oward Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan ""fieldhearings"" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today'slegislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, ubert umphrey took him aside andsaid, ""You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That'show you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly."" umphrey's career advice: ""You should become Mr. ousing.ousing is the future.""The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, andaelerated as publicans became the majority in 1981. ""The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number ofpeople just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs,"" Gary art, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. ""Theywere harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look aommodationist compared topublicans in the Senate today."" Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, ""It was a huge loss of the most experienced,aomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been thereless than six years."" e added, ""The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It getsworse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from elms and the younger ones: 'Othersdidn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'""After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room dealsbegan to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. ""So Damn Much Money,"" a recent book by the Washington Postreporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal publicansbegan to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative publicans. Bipartisancoalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his ownfund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Membersof both parties—oward Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse elms, the North Carolina publican—took toregularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up inthe eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate andescalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democratsfilibustered publican nominees to the bench; then publicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-called ""nuclear option."" Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the publican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went toSouth Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, m Daschle (who went on to lose). A few yearsearlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that everyelection had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action wasbetween the White ouse and the Gingrich ouse of presentatives; during the Bush years, the publican Senatemajority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasinglybecome populated by ""ideologues and charlatans."" e went on, ""When we do get good people who come in, they veryquickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to staythere."" e spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa publican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last yearworking closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in , Grassley went home and, faced withangry publican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about ""pulling the plug onGrandma."" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin ""altering his behavior and abandoningevery issue, including campaign-finance reform.""One morning in , I visited arry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his fingerdown the list of senators. e did it again. ""I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."" ewas stumped. ""Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."" eput the directory aside. ""I'm just having the damnedest time.""Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former publican senator from Florida; he was hiredlast year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (e has since moved on toJPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. mDaschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, untilPresident Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease withwhich he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.In 2007, Trent Lott, a publican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formeda lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-yearwaiting period between serving and lobbying.When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The ouse of presentatives seemsmiles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White ouse is another country, and actual foreigncountries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commutethirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under ConstitutionAvenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says ""Men's Gallery""), andthe Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out aording to seniority, wheresenators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority overthe institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.Riddick, called ""Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices,"" which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, wasknown to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presidingofficer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" is still faintly visible. ""The Senate, by itsnature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount,"" Lamar Alexander said. ""And that'snot changed."" Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of itsmembers to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "" have a chamberthat rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.""In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, ofMinnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration ofsenior senators. ""If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific,"" Chris Dodd said. ""My worry is they won't stay. Because it's notproductive.""The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, theiryoung Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and ""secret holds""—when a senatoranonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On  20th, ClaireMcCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, andJon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanshipbetween the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. MichaelBennet said, ""We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and wherethings have been put off for a really long period of time."" e mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financialcrisis. ""Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.""We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottledwater, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has todefend it this year. e described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow tooattached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: ""And then somemore veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteenmonths or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems.""Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On  4th,Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama publican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventyObama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (is tactics exposed, Shelby—whose officemaintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent severaldays and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployedAmericans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, ""ugh shit."" (Eventually, publicans persuadedBunning to stop.)These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without suess. In2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or moresenators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called ""rolling holds""—and their party leader facilitates the game bykeeping their names secret.Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures ofpartisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they neededtime to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical aident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rulethat allowed the ""previous question"" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by theeighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talkinguntil their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word ""filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for ""looter."")In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a ""cloture"" vote. For decades, the rule was rarelyused; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies andeighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower thethreshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, asboth parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the publicans losttheir majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and2008, and this session publicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passedby the ouse have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. ""Why?"" Steny oyer, the outragedDemocratic Majority Leader of the ouse, asked me. ""Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitatesnoncontroversial things. Thankfully, the ouse of presentatives is not becoming the Senate."" Last week, six ouseDemocrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of theObama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to runthe General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection wassubstantive, publicans ransacked Riddick's ""Senate Procedure"" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his publican colleagues. m Coburn demanded the reading aloudof an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senateclerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.Under McConnell, publicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislativemaneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. m arkin, who firstproposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his publican colleagues ""nihilists,"" who want to create chaos because itserves their ideology. ""If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions,"" arkin said. ""In chaos people don't listento reason."" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the publican strategyreflects the views of a majority of Americans. In , he told the Times, "" the extent that they""—the Democrats—""want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful.  theextent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful.""One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; SusanCollins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexandersaid that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, ""When you have your back against the wall and the gallowsare hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.""Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: ""e saidif we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant."" Last , the publicans decided to filibuster amilitary-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. ThadCochran, the publican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, thathe wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and bringsdisproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told id that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote withthe Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)publican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulusbill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-reform bill last , the only publican to do so. But in , at the pivotal moment, she voted against theversion that went before the full Senate. ""I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committeeversion—it grew by a thousand pages,"" Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White ouse officialsthat took place in an elegant conference room across from id's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats ""did notaept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch."" McConnell was able to exploit heralienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: ""She actually said to me once that she had never feltthe pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real ortroubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a seniorpublican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' ""id doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senatorwho helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterlymaneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverageof McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per centof the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few newsenators have considered a radical option: mutiny.m Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. e has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spenttime in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. is father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the InteriorSecretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark isa freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the ouse before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.""I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas,"" he said. ""Then to be on the inside—the thingthat strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.""In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amendthem, making it extremely difficult. (""Rule XXII is a Catch-22,"" Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a differentidea—the ""constitutional option."" Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that ""each ouse may determine the Rulesof its Proceedings"" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next  andpropose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There'seven a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearingson the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate whenthe constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized workinggroups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs bycaucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competingfor the favor of newer members, in case arry id loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for MajorityLeader.)For publican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. ""If you want aparliamentary form of government, go over to the ouse,"" Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. ""Why even run for theSenate?"" Udall's plan for next , he said, would be a ""gigantic mistake.""""They'll get over it,"" Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. ""And they'll get over it quicker if they'rein the minority next . Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever theyhave to say."" e added that the Senate ""may be getting done about as much as the American people want done."" ThePresident's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the publicans Ispoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is ""broken."" Alexander claimed that he and other publicans wereexercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. ""The Senate wasn'tcreated to be efficient,"" he argued. ""It was created to be inefficient."" At one of the filibuster hearings, in , Alexander,sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the publicans with obstructinglegislation, ""we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offeramendments, which is the essence of the Senate.""Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform isinevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. Aording to Sarah Binder,a change in rules is extremely unlikely; publicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, andso would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. ""I would oppose that,"" Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,""These are people who have never been in the minority."" For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adeptat working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,the sole enthusiast for rules reform is m arkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not betweenwhales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too austomed to the Senate'sways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate publicans are too weak to challenge thenewer radicals who now dominate the caucus.Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next , the Senate will remain a sclerotic,wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,who have created a culture where cqueville's ""lofty thoughts"" and ""generous impulses"" have no place.A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financialregulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to winreal bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailoutWall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In , a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachsappeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, andevasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some publicans had a genuine desire topass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.The affair began with a publican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their firstterm, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor ofChattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor ofVirginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having todo with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They workedthrough the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members ofa Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, AlanGreenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and publican stilltalking to each other. In , Business Week called them the Senate's ""Odd Couple."" By , they had finishedtheir work.Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top publican on the committee,dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on  10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of thecommittee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's publican negotiating partner. When Corker informedMcConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. ""It was an odd place to be,"" Corker recalled. ""And yet that night webegan meeting."" The junior publican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. Inresponse, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among publicans and their lobbyiststhat he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other publicans of theParty's line on financial reform.)On  10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. e called Corker and said, ""You've been a greatpartner."" e was ending their talks after only a month. ""It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest,"" Corker told reportersafterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss avisham, unable to get over therebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talksunder pressure from the White ouse and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any otherpublicans with him. ""Baloney,"" Corker said. ""If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-five publican votes.""The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and publicans alike,incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.But in mid- Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parrotingtalking points from a memo written by the publican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a ""partisan bill"" that ""will guaranteeperpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks."" McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one publicans,suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.is remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day,  15th, Corker pleadedwith his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, ""Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to bethe people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with coolerheads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that onfinancial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ."" Corker didn't allow thethought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any publican would have dared.Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: ""I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are facedwith a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I amnot naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then whyare we even here?"" e went on, ""We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking outfor their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intenton proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friendsof mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part ofthe solution.""In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, ausing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, hechopped the air with his hand as he shouted, ""I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four orfive months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I haveto say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!""Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. ""You and I went a longway,"" Corker told Dodd. ""Then we stopped. On  10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democratson your committee.""""And I was not gaining publicans,"" Dodd replied.""You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I didnot leave the table."" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to publicans—their differences could be sorted out in a fewdays.But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-reform brawl: the publicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyistsprowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On  28th, I was sitting in the ornateception Room with Jim Manley, id's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniturescraping across a tile floor. ""Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room,"" Manley said. ""Very little happens aroundhere without a deadline."" The cots persuaded publicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weekslater, on  20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to avote. It passed, 59-39. Only four publicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. e had even voted foran amendment, offered by his publican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's workof many months with Warner.""The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!"" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtainedoffice, under a print of olbein's portrait of Thomas More. ""It's the Senate, I guess."" McConnell's strategy of obstructionhad once again come close to sueeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a ""shrinking number"" of publicans werefrustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, ""God, I would have loved to have you as my rankingmember on this."" Collins responded, ""We could have had such a great time on this bill.""Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because ""the American people don't trust either political party enoughto give them a blank check,"" was astonished that so few publicans voted for financial reform. ""There was zerosubstantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes,"" he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on thebill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, ""If you want to vote against something, youcan always find your reasons.""But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. e had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienatinghimself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirtyminutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. ""I am obviously disappointed,"" he said. ""I think I have spent asmuch time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things init. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough timewas spent on some of the core issues.""As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of ""So Damn Much Money,"" in the press gallery. I laterasked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of theSenate. ""If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away moneyand interest groups,"" he said. ""But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all thingsconsidered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: hereyou've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.""After the final vote on financial reform, the publicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. id said, ""For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, itdidn't work."" e then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with ""some Nevadans.""Durbin said, ""I was stunned that only four publicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it taketo bring the publican Party into the conversation about the future of America?""Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, ""I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct itsbusiness much as our founders intended. We did that.""On  21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financialregulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. Theydepended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,arry id announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments onthe list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senateslipping back into stagnant waters.ILLUSTRATION: STEVE BRODNER• Print• E-Mail• FeedsShare:• Facebook• Twitter• Digg• More get more of The New Yorker's signature mix of politics, culture and the arts: Subscribe nowlated LinksAsk the Author: Join a live chat with George Packer about the Senate on ,  4, at 3 P.M.

ThePanel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of eachgovernment's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid suchincidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the internationalcommunity. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents fromrecurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey tomove beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work willbe the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for anyoverlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister ofNew Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair.We look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey.###This email is .This email is ."

I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that todaywe come to the end of the program here on the President's Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the Whiteouse meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representingCameroon at this forum?I have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a newAfrica believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions toensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processesand structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities.While traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways togetting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches,conversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff,Senators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when wedecide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa.This thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back tothe nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nationsaround the world...When our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if wedared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, ""That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DAREtake some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commitothers to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group asnothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world.The work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every suess like coming to America, to theWhite ouse and meeting with President Obama is sweet. Therefore I come back to work to be the change I want to seein Cameroon.I thank you all for the opportunity."

UDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010One day in  2009, in elmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees metwith Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of suess stories for the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk ofbeing killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring andbasic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.COMMENTS (22) SARE:TwitterdditBuzzEMore...As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.'What are they saying?"" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. ""They are telling you to go back to yourcountry and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quiteliterally die if the Taliban return,"" she said.In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeuswhether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate ""reformed""Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.Carefully avoiding the word ""women,"" the general assured the questioning student that only ""moderate"" Taliban would beeligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of ""moderate,"" which clearly depends on where you sit:If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a ""moderate"" Taliban.Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the ""moderate""Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- anduntil we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school andof Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A fewmonths after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, ""The last time we met in thischamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going toschool. day women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government.""The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. Theystrong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are nottreated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped apage from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues, appearsto be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustainedrhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Sincethen, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras intoincluding women in 2010? Forget it.It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stagesof the oupation have come home to roost. President amid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rightsabusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by ausingsenior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But theirsuffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistanstill makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. Inthe countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in thefirst place. Aording to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women reportbeing beaten on a regular basis.In  of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stingingofficial condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, ""Thecurrent reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course ofseeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them."" Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. er husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinatedsoon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain deathwhile their murderers face 100 percent impunity.For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equalitywas always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through thedeployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's Affairs.Indeed, just before his recent ""election,"" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measuresdesigned to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzaisuessfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or haveguardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women's aess towork, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for ""legitimate"" purposes. EvenKarzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, justwait until the Americans leave.This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount offinancial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State illary Clinton said in , ""The subjugation of women is athreat to the national security of the United States."" On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states withhigher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a betterpredictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie,along with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development ofIslamic suicide terrorism.So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doingmore to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan ""culture"" does notallow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from onecoalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: 'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will onlyalienate them [Afghans]."" Of course, ""them"" here refers only to men.But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghanwomen were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole ofgender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and womenbravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americansassume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,despite increasing female recruitment and even ""female engagement teams,"" remains a bastion of masculinity, with littlesensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almostexclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no comment fromthe Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not onlydamages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-oldAfghan male pointed out, ""Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploitwomen in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?"" Added another Afghan USAID programmerworking in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, ""It would be better for the coalition if they could figureout a way to limit this kind of material.""We can do better -- much better.The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protectingwomen's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.The military should spend less time courting ""moderate"" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders howgender equality -- including female aess to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternaland child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in allgovernance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming ""peace jirga"" that will include the Taliban.Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent.Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women'sissues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, ""There is only one minister in the cabinet, andshe is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, inBamiyan."" Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingentupon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.Better yet, the coalition needs to support ""regime change"" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom amoderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghanpopulation is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given achance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable tomarry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination ofDiscrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council solution 1325 on women, peace, andsecurity. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that ithas committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equalityenshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights andfundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, takingmeasures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisorygroup of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has takento implement the treaty's provisions.Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate andunique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as activeagents in peace and security.Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing ofthe Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before. change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistanand the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existencenot fit for animals.We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should haveno faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality andsecurity, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to theissue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan arethe right ones: ""Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political,and economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.""American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women cancontinue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faithwith American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.Save bio when you subscribe to FP.Majid Saeedi/Getty Image"

5543,5544,109,0,113.0,577,3,1,3,"Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to alityBy BARRY MEIERThe likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate withoutelectrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer, aording to a study published .The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher, Dr. Gust . Bardy, at the SeattleInstitute for Cardiac search in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and otherresearchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were suessful.Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit tofunction, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires poserisks because they can, on rare oasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A powerunit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.The new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long-term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if suessful, theunit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the newstudy nonetheless.Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device couldsomeday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get adefibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.In recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has beenprone to fracturing. undreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also,scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult ordangerous.Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injurieswere a factor in his interest in developing the new device.""You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,"" he said.In the study published , Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several suessfulinitial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.The device is being developed by Cameron ealth, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr.Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gonethrough several iterations.The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that alsoinclude a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These arelargely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythmthat can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.owever, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.Before the device can be sold here, Cameron ealth will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr.Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year ormore to assemble data from it for the agency's review."
5544,5545,2947,0,7.0,579,3,1,3," 8, 2010Gary SickAmerica and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and ScapegoatsFor the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israeland/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to changeits nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and thecrowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis itis either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to our, it would have been at the end of the Bushadministration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted itunequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from hissubsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potentialconsequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and thereported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that BarackObama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their securityand survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam ussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraqin the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out ofIraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq hadabandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people andhis enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that therewas no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmenmanaged the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotundTariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would begood for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions hadmade criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. Thebiggest – and most suessful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddamussein.Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web offinancial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significantproblems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because ofcheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hardcurrency.At the same time, because Iran's oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintainproduction. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oilcompanies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted byIran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outsideinvestors. As a result, Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soakedup by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran's hard currencyearnings are drying up at an alarming rate.This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competenteconomic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, the Supreme Leader,seems totally preoupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the volutionaryGuards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regimecould have imagined.President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the volutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandishand irresponsible rhetoric. is words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effectdrives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctionsagainst Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossadagent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At thesame time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the ""third rail"" ofIranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. is initial efforts to reduce the amount ofsubsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.But these rules now seem to be grudgingly aepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. e is nowaddressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closingthe bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including theInternational Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economicinterests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembleshis populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to uey Long to ugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America andIsrael the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of hisown eentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iranis capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. Thevolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military, its economy, and its politics. Iranincreasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s thatwe call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far rightwho choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmaticconservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whoseobjective is to put the ""republic"" back into the Islamic public by giving the people a greater voice.This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration willback the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoupied withdomestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it willinadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoatfor everything that goes wrong in Iran."

During the call, the Secretarystressed that, in our view, Iran's recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually takingsteps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. There's nothing new and nothing encouraging inIran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the internationalcommunity, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to theIAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensifyefforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched onother subjects, including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan."

We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attentionfor her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim amidi, an 18-year old charged withhomosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither oftheir cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authoritiesand his family members had been detained.We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right tofree expression after the  2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad aj Aghaei, and Javad Lan.The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in aordance with its international obligationsto the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisonersand imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world whoseek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties."

5584,5585,2973,0,7.0,529,3,1,3,"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16iht-edcohen.html?2=1&emc=eta18,pagewanted=print 15, 2010Inners arid LosersEy ROGER COENNEW YORK — The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on  30 for illary Clinton's longtime aide, ume Abedin,and what struck one of the many guests was the absence of anyone from President Obama's tight White ouse innercircle.Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row, including ouse SpeakerNancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin'smarriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White ouse insiders stayed away.Well, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, ""I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted illary to win"" —old wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the oldgrievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:No, they don't and they never will. But, we're public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.Speaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated  4, she was inArmenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia andTurkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.You've got to salute illary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of statewhen the White ouse puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — andyou're left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you're lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.The situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White ouse — and they are overwhelmingly boys — wereforeign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told enry Kissinger refers to them as ""the kids.""Chief among them, aording to my colleague elene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council's chiefof staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: ""Forget Secretary of State illary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary RobertM. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans.""I do know McDonough and I've spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. e has many of the state's qualities: positive,brisk, can-do, affable and efficient.But am I reassured when! read that Obama's national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. e was a greatguy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but he's not a great guy tothink big about the world.Thinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are anAfghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiationwith the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctionshave changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.Then there's Israel-Palestine, where Obama can't decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on bothsides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he's zigzagging to little effect.After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-policy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French —the French love that — but he's left most people unconvinced. m Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around the vacuumas best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and hm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should theybe foreign-policy strategists?In Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-Karabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White ouse annex for non-critical affairs.Back in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York erald, a forebear of the International eraldTribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named enry Morton Stanley:""Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.""e was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on LakeTanganyika, uttering the immortal words: ""tor Livingstone, I presume?""That sort of journalism's gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and tellingMichael astings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, astings did that. e also foundsomething else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.McChrystal's gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch this space."

5593,5594,2981,0,2.0,588,3,1,3,FYI
5595,5596,2980,0,51.0,588,3,1,3,"And pasted below is the exchange between Corker and olbrooke:CORKER:Mr. Chairman, thank you.I want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country formany years.A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way.But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with adefinition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and adetailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progresstowards achieving those objectives.I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while Irespect the ambassador, I've heard a lot of process. I've heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea -- no earthlyidea what our objectives are on the civilian front.And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time,from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though.And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe SecretaryClinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed to come.But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place?OLBROOKE:I'm sorry. You don't feel that I've told you what our civilian programs are?CORKER:You've told me a lot of process. I'd like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the veryquestion we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan forachieving those. I'd like to hear you talk about that.I mean, I'm glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I'm not hearing anything that talks about where we'regoing.I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working within the country.OLBROOKE:First of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within theconstraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the recordand which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs.The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedentedeffort.Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural productsuntil 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of thiswar.We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely ina joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs,encouraging alternatives to opium production.OLBROOKE:Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justicesystem which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system.Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing byeradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban.Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level.Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. SenatorKerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of theinternational presence.The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter-insurgency effort. e and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have workedintimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wishin private briefings on behalf of me and my team.Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end stateand exit strategy.If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, theconsequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reactionthat would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region thatincludes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism fromthat region, just as much as we are.So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continuedAmerican economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and themilitary. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated forthe military campaign.When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It willbe a gradual process. And that is what the review in  and the president's decision-making will focus on.CORKER:In our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's beensomething that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, thatwe're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough.I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical ofthem. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It'sjust incredibly vague to me.And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don'tknow what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just hadcolleagues who have come from there.We've had a -- we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because hedoesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they'remaking aommodations on both sides.So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that weare in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be suessful. And we don't havethe will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined.But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that'swhat we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship.But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence,so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific.But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned.And I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, evenwithin the administration itself, and that has to end.And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I wouldask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envisionAfghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand.We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, thebar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same pageas much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined.OLBROOKE:Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understandyour comments and I respect them.First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are wein Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that whileour enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have tostrengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can moveforward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida.Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I thinkthe Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is.Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And wehave benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here isalways the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States.And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face outthere is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation ourred, and I don't think anything couldhave proved it more vividly.And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure -- adifferent part, but an integral part -- that we face.Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. ow could they after 30 yearsof war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law,subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues --are part of our civilian programs.And we're happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue.Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establishconditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues,and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time."

""I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.""A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in aradically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailedthe Oslo aords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to ""beat them up,not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable"" (all translations are mine).PI to aaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be ""Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, anddistributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.""Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after steppingdown as prime minister in 1999. e appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the PalestinianAuthority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United Stateswould let such an attack come to fruition.""I know what America is,"" Netanyahu replied. ""America is'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.They won't get in their way."" e then called former president Bill Clinton ""radically pro-Palestinian,"" and went on to belittlethe Oslo peace aords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the aords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on topre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the aords by defining vastswaths of land as just that.""They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo aords],"" Netanyahu said. ""I said I would, but ... I'm going tointerpret the aords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the '67 borders. ow didwe do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I'mconcerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.""Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israelalone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. ""They didn't want to give me thatletter,"" Netanyahu said, ""so I didn't give them the ebron agreement [the agreement giving ebron back to thePalestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that meeting, tome and to Arafat, did I ratify the ebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto putan end to the Oslo aords.""President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tapeonline here PI.lated: Tricky Bibi l2) [aaretz]Article printed from Tablet Magazine: http://www,tabletmag.comURL to article: http://wwvv.tabletmag.com/scro11/39692/fibi-netanyahu/URLs in this post:[1] said: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html[2] Aording: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/tricky-bibi-1.302053[3] here: http://news.nana10.co.il/Articie/?Articield=731025&sid=126Click here to print.Copyright © 2010 Tablet Magazine.

The very fact of it is a big deal.Context is important. This is not out of the blue, it's not just a random gathering; it's part of a systematic process:Karzai's inauguration, announcement of the President's strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabulconference.Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, servicedelivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious;and they reflect months of work and consultation.Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill,de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. Thisis NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan governmentleadership and ownershipFollow-through and aountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghangovernment committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, we'll be heavily focusedon implementation. This is about mutual aountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth. 2011: The president's strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts totake the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civiliancommitment to support Afghanistan long into the future.Clear strategy: verse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghansdevelop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsibletransition to Afghan leadership.Clear desired end-state: An Afghan state that is willing and strong enough to ensure that global terrorists never againhave safe haven within its borders; can withstand internal and external threats; and can continue to make long-termpolitical and economic progress, all with sustainable levels of international support.Civ-mil cooperation: Unfortunate to lose General McChrystal, but maintained continuity with General Petraeus and wehave only intensified our civ-mil engagement both in Kabul and Washington.conciliation: Stress that it is Afghan-led. Note red-lines."

Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Misturawas very sympathetic and said they should be consulted, that the current documents are working documents and hepledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. e also told them that he was very impressed thatthey had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious,but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at 's Kabul Conference, butAfghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will rollback their hard-fought rights.As illary Clinton prepares to attend 's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message togovernment and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,"" said Soraya Pakzad, founderof a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of erat. er comment came during an unusually heated question-and-answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan deMistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. ""We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want ourpresence to be purely symbolic.""""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations oraords.""The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to 's London Conference, the gathering marksthe first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transitionfrom foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descendupon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. Thegoal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of thecountry's political and economic direction.Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations ofcorruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is thedirection in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feelthe stakes for this week's meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that mightthreaten women's rights.""After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations andnegotiations,"" said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. ""This is very important for us, to get a serious andhonest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not besilenced.""Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view 's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about theirconcerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at thetable. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet morning with a group of women leaders.gardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything asidefrom more paper and more unkept promises.""Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,"" said SelayGhaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. ""We want things to change.""And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering todiscuss their future.""Women in the provinces don't even know about this,"" said Zainab, a young math teacher from elmand province. ""Iwould say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.""Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they saythey fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.""This is very dangerous,"" said Shahida ussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a communityorganizer during the Taliban years. ""We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fearwar again.""Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women'sconstitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.""Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and integration Plan,"" said thewomen in a statement at the end of their meeting. ""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in anypeace negotiations or aords.""In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as  approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that womenwould be more involved going forward.""I agree, you were not consulted,"" said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a fewmoments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. ""As usual, we have been paying lip service toyou and we are all at fault for that.""Gayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington.

5639,5640,3014,0,15.0,595,3,1,3,"WASINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financialsanctions  in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile withinsurgents.The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. Itfollows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the topmilitary commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, forsanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. membercountries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the aqqani network, which,directsoperations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned was Nasiruddin aqqani, an emissary for the aqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin aqqani who leadsthe group with his father, Jalaluddin.Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah, theformer treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders asterrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director ofTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financialnetworks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,"" he said.Aording to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacksin Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. e has served as amain financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled toKuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings andcommunications with key leaders. Nasiruddin aqqani has collected funds for the aqqani group, including from al-Qaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commandersfrom the aqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largelyaelerated after the  1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident,Pakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to theU.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas."

5641,5642,3015,0,7.0,586,3,1,3,": I'm sure you are preoupied with the adventures of Lula, et al. Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NYview, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It's worth reading, not least for FrankLuntz's poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted inthis long-term and profound development. Sidhttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment 10, 2010by Peter BeinartE-mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinartanjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John SpringsIn 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired publican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewishcollege students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced themost damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. ""Sixtimes we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,"" hereported. ""Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word'they' rather than'us` to describe the situation.""That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words ofSteven Cohen of ebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that ""non-Orthodoxyounger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,"" with many professing ""a near-totalabsence of positive feelings."" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored universityin America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against somefirm beliefs. First, ""they reserve the right to question the Israeli position."" These young Jews, Luntz explained, ""resistanything they see as 'group think."" They want an ""open and frank"" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, ""youngJews desperately want peace."" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled ""Proof thatIsrael Wants Peace,"" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, ""someempathize with the plight of the Palestinians."" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values ofAmerican Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to humanrights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity andcapable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz didnot grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishmenthas been working against for most of their lives.Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted tothe State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted tohuman rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the youngergenerations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—aZionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For severaldecades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to theirhorror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidentsof Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secularAmerican Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jewscan help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz'sstudents wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of ebrewUniversity political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, ""After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionistnarrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions."" One version, ""founded on a long memory ofpersecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only inJewish power and solidarity."" Another, ""nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenmentidea of progress,"" articulates ""a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.""Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.You can see this spirit in ""new historians"" like m Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionistpast and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate thehuman rights guarantees in Israel's ""Basic Laws."" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparentwillingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power.  the contrary, it is gasping for air. understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worthconsidering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnicallycleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. ""We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from hereand remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,"" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party intoNetanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas ""campusengagement."" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government'sbehalf. The group that organized his tour was called ""Caravan for Democracy.""Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's nowbanned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. ieberman's position might becalled ""pre-expulsion."" e wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewishstate. e tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for theKnesset. e said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of amas should be executed. e wants to jailArabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs fromother countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The moreyou strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you ause them of treason, the more thinkable a policy ofexpulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What theyusually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of IsraeliArabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among theNations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. Infact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,he has declared, would be a ""ghetto-state"" with ""Auschwitz borders."" And the effort ""to gouge Judea and Samaria [theWest Bank] out of Israel"" resembles itler's bid to wrench the German-speaking ""Sudeten district"" from Czechoslovakia in1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenchingconcessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of theJewish state.On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it mayhave is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox partyrepresenting Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxiousto find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidiesit is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And theyhave done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi OvadiaYosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs ""vipers,"" ""snakes,"" and ""ants."" In 2005, after PrimeMinister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that ""God strike him down."" Theofficial Shas newspaper recently called President Obama ""an Islamic extremist.""ebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in aaretz, he wrote, ""The last time politiciansholding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain."" With theirblessing, ""a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.""Sternhell should know. In  2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israelisociety: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical andmore entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone toanti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percentof recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst amongIsrael's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This , a poll found that 56percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey ""a hugewarning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.""You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would oasionsubstantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. InIsrael itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an ""apartheid state"" if itcontinues to hold the West Bank. This , when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical ofthe oupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that ""Israel has not been democratic forsome time now."") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse,scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearnfor peace.The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to ""free speech and minority rights."" The Conference of Presidentsdeclares that ""Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,security and peace."" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deservefull citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anythingany Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the veryliberal values they profess to admire.After Israel's elections last , for instance, Malcolm oenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was ""far more moderate than the media has presented it.""Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that ""e's not saying expel them. e's not saying punish them.""(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Dayevidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American JewishCommittee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would ""chill Israel's democratic political debate.""But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline ""JewishLeaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.""Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries toprevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged acampaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an AmnestyInternational report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians ""bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic."" The Conferenceof Presidents has announced that ""biased NGOs include Amnesty International, uman Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]Save the Children."" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that uman Rights Watch ""has repeatedlydemonstrated its anti-Israel bias."" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to MaryRobinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she hadpresided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference reportimplicitly aused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)uman Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—theyleave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simplydefending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionistvisions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an ""animus toward Israel,"" analliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, likeB'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Oupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for umanRights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have AmnestyInternational and uman Rights Watch.All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights criticsare motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally saythat, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon,called the anti-oupation group Peace Now a ""virus."" This , a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu aused Israelihuman rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. AKnesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supportssome of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed atcurbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s. their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their ownwork. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's governmentis motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who makethe same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equalcitizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generationalreasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they areunmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want themto be agents of the Israeli right.These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up tothe Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, whenmuch of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often inconjunction with the olocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jewsembraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,politics, and theology of oupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, moreinnocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed onIsrael's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, theyhave grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an oupying power. As a result, they are more conscious thantheir parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemptionbecause its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace theiruncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishmentis fake. sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere toreplenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bankoupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from theOrthodox world.Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of theAmerican Jewish population. Aording to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews makeup only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen andtwenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivasthey learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, andoften know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent ofnon-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel ""very close to Israel,"" among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. Assecular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. TheOrthodox ""are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,"" explains Samuel eilman, a sociologist at the City Universityof New York. ""They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights.""But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among theOrthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, hefound Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,form, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and todeny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched inthe American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democraticveneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israelsolidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling theestimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense PaulWolfowitz told the rally that ""innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,"" he was booed.America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: anAmerican Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewishpopulation that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end upamong the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds ofhouses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator andpolitician named mmy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid theruins of her home. e said she reminded him of his grandmother.In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life.  begin with, hewatched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A d Cross study onmalnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israelihuman rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to fosterZionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word ""Arabs, not Palestinians,"" since""the term `Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,"" while ""Arab' says wealth, oiland Islam.""Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they aremorally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifieseverything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would haveto do or say to make them scream ""no."" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabsbarred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. ow dare he defile thememory of the olocaust? Of course, the olocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.•But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the olocaustanalogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only aboutthemselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treatedthe non-Jews living under their dominion. ""For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,"" Knessetmember Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, ""and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews livewith a minority.""But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly theopposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is aluxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in hisremarkable 2008 book, The olocaust Is Over; We Must Rise  Its Ashes, ""Victimhood sets you free.""This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simplybears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from ezbollahand amas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possessdozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not thedilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewishvictimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most oftoday's young American Jews as farce.But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel'sIndependence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state ""will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice andpeace taught by the ebrew prophets,"" and in the  1948 letter from Albert Einstein, annah Arendt, and othersto The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his party'smilitias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewishfortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use ofJewish power.For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every  to the East Jerusalem neighborhoodof Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without apermit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling intothe thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at illel? What if this was theface of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that theirgeneration faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish stateon earth?""o many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,"" writes Avraham Burg. ""Iwas very comfortable there."" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moralabdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster anuncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let's hopethey care enough to try.— 12, 2010 .Peter Beinart is Associate Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York, a SeniorFellow at the New America Foundation, and Senior Political Writer for The Daily Beast. is new book, The IcarusSyndrome: A istory of American ubris, will be published in ."

S14 16, 2010, 11:01 pmChomsky Barred  West Bank by IsraelBy ROBERT MACKEYNoam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the WestBank on  by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver alecture.Amira ass of the Israeli newspaper aaretz reported:No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridgeborder crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on.A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told uters that there had been a misunderstanding and ""officials weretrying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls aess to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.""In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, ""the facts werecompletely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding."" e explained that he was interrogated forseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the oupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-old scholar added:I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — hewas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One wasthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I supposeevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking aninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the pastbut not this time.Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at thePalestinian university in Ramallah.The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in  2009 andhas criticized Israel's oupation of Palestinian territory many times.In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, ""I objected to thefounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would objectto the United States as a Christian state."" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,""Your father was a respected ebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,"" he replied:It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews.

With 14 years at the helm of the small butinfluential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life inour region.On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects withfar-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems andby becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceedsfrom the sale of annarville habilitation Center, a nonprofit, to ealthSouth, a for-profitorganization.The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the armarvillehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and peoplewith disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with armarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer andending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized theimpact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focusedfoundation,"" she said.Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 millionhas been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people withdisabilities in all aspects of life, especially aess to health care. Programs have become nationalmodels.Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medicalstaff often struggle to aommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed moneyfor the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens ospital of UPMC, one of the firstsuch clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving aess to healthcarefor people with disabilities.Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project atAchieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center forPatients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine.FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events moreaessible and helping places of worship more welcoming""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have theissues we have,"" said Kim utchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, basedin Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helpedsolve are ones that people have been working on for years.""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholderstogether to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISAand former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in thecommunity and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.""Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.""""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learnedsomething, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else'sideas and efforts.""In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. Anew frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""Wehave to keep the fire burning.""On  19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's programdirector for six years, was promoted to executive director.""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide thefoundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We knowthat we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing thepopulations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community."""

BergerSamuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor toPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White ouse on , tackles a delicate butunavoidable question: ow do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home anda reordering of political power abroad?For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulfunderscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America'smilitary supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club ofpowerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costsand benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats withoutothers, nor should we bear the burden alone.Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily becomelaborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon tome and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informsadministration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey thepresident's principles and priorities.In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks withpast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclearproliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscalburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economicand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Pointspeech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintainedits military and political primacy.""Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, thepresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening aglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effortstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each havedeployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence andvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the GlobalWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and itsterrorist affiliates.""This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never aepted thebroader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan andturn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam ussein's Iraq.In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored aless provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated therationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores theprinciples that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all thecosts and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right toact unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton oftendescribed as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. ThePresident sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the internationalcommunity's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrateto the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage havehelped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal tonegotiate.Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal ofdoubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama andColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lieahead.In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties torestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our suess during the dark days of the Cold War. Despitethe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supportedthe containment of communism.In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out ourdifferences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, orthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goalsspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; sueedingin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order ofenlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based."

The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, anddenounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seekshis father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of his sonBibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe,except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's EhudBarak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film, Munich.Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to have escapedthe participants.)Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as theBush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from theanalogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did theIsraelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peaceprocess, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under anycircumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president.

We did not make concessions on our redlines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, aording to people whoheard him speak.Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in. Aording to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that theIsraeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will ""makesure"" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take ""aggressive"" action and constructionwill be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. ""The statements attributed to the prime minister areincorrect,"" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. ""They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason issimple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by PresidentObama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region.""Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week mightattest to a radical change in the White ouse's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meetingas ""the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number ofweeks."" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months agobetween the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continuedconstruction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was ""no longer an absoluteally of the United States.""That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire amongmembers of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to end the crisisis the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in . ""The Democratic Party's coffers are empty.Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, theywould be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,"" said one source in Washington.The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two monthsago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken togetherand to give statements to the media.That said, sources in Washington noted that ""Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap onceagain. e knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficultquestions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.'""Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's aeptanceinto the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement throughthe city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings."

Judis•  12, 2010 I 12:00 amOn  14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators wereamassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the""five pillars"" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program thatwould evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson'sGreat Society.Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. ""We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—afoundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,"" he declared. Obamawould repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more oasions over the next months. At Obama's privateWhite ouse dinner with presidential historians that , the historians were no more impressed than the public withthe New Foundation as a slogan. ""I don't think it's going to work,"" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said itsounded ""like a woman's girdle.""One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuessfully deployed by aDemocratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, ""night, I want toexamine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and aprosperous world."" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he askedmembers of Congress to join him ""in building that new foundation."" Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, afew underwear jokes and was then forgotten.Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging overhis presidency. Of course, Obama has already aomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during hisentire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspiredcampaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors andinitially stirred hopes of a ""transformational"" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect withlarge parts of the electorate. be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both mencontended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and hisparty tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerfulbusiness lobby, and Obama has dealt with a publican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been aninability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed fromyeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, inBill Clinton's words, ""those who work hard and play by the rules."" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoricthat goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Streetlobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or m arkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald agan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturnshave enjoyed suess, while those who have spurned it have suffered aordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That'swhat Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of theGreat cession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among publicans, and some of his first efforts, including the$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the  defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey andVirginia. By  2010, it was a crucial factor in publican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley inMassachusetts.In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reformwhile the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. Whatdoomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In anatmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparentthat financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played avery large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the ""moneychangers,"" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise""speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. ""Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed andirresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a newage,"" he declared.Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times callingthe bonuses they gave themselves ""shameful"" and an ""outrage""—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from thebankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on  28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesmanRobert Gibbs said, ""emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street."" And, in hisGeorgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, ""was caused bya perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to MainStreet.""Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bankand insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowingbankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, hewould fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—insharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations oreven to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in  2009, Obamaand his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. e appointed TimothyGeithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president ofthe Federal serve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO JamieDimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers gounder, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditorswith government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. tiring DemocraticSenator Byron Dorgan told me, ""Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and theadministration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.""By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newlyformed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a lessextreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early  New York Times/CBS News poll, the publicdisapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama'shandling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economicpolicies to his handling of the financial crisis.Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties beganwith the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonusesto the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were nolegal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman ChrisDodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) ""The pitchforks were out. It added injury toinjury,"" Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. Aording to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had afavorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and healthcare reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was ""where's my bailout?"" (Obama himselfacknowledged that it was ""one of the most frequent questions"" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became abailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailoutfor the uninsured—or ""reparations,"" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, ""hardworkingcitizens were getting sick of being played for chumps"" by ""moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, tramplingover themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts."" Obama and the Democrats were suessfully portrayedas aiding ""the moochers,"" but not the ""hardworking citizens."" In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster.Some in the White ouse political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts werebeing defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the Whiteouse began calling themselves the ""pitchfork gang,"" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get toughon Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head LarrySummers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. ""There was a continual tension in the White ouse,""says a person who was privy to the discussions. ""One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial itback.""By early  of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. Aording to a CNN poll, 60 percentof Americans thought Obama ""had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions""than to the ""problems faced by middle class Americans."" Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paidmore attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White ouse temporarily embraceda populist approach. On  14, Obama called the bank bonuses ""obscene"" and said, ""we want our money back."" In a 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used theword ""fighting"" 13 times and ""fight"" nine times. ""I will not stop fighting for you,"" he declared.But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On  io,he said that he didn't ""begrudge"" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEOLloyd Blankfein. ""I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.""Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,but, on  16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, anemboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their ""failure of responsibility."" As a result of theindictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, publicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderatepublicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much strongerbill than the Democrats had ever expected.But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon'sIvan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in , the presidentdispatched Geithner, White ouse aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama hassaid enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response tothe BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama'simage, the greatest drop from  2009 to this  was in the perception of Obama as a ""strong leader."" Voters willsometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or agan, whom they regard as ""strong,""but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the Whiteouse's weak political performance.In , when the White ouse debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council ofEconomic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the ouse Budget Committee,told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administrationfinally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulatesaving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated forinfrastructure spending.Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus wasnecessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduceunemployment, publicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additionalKeynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White ouse advisers appear to haveunderestimated the depth of the Great cession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political cloutto get more from Congress.But the White ouse might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked publicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly madethis sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn'titself a result of political timidity.The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what hethought it could aomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, tothe dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White ouse aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue.  thento Labor Day, he devoted a  visit to Buffalo and an  stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time whenthe right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; hedidn't really try.Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what agan did in 1982. Faced withsteadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in  to 10.4 percent in , agan and hispolitical staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling forvoters to ""stay the course"" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. ""We are clearing awaythe economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,"" agan declared. Democrats aused them of playing ""the blamegame,"" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White ouse for ten months, worked. The publicans werepredicted to lose as many as 50 ouse seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.Some commentators have noted agan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, hedid much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience withagan's program. Aording to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressedconfidence that agan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at apostwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought agan's economicprogram would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a suessful political operation. If Obama could commandthose numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in . But Obama has not been able to develop anarrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.Why has the White ouse failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit isclearly Barack Obama. e has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. is aversion is strange because he wasschooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachingsof the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for arvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarialtactics behind.The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very differentstyle of politics. Obama's principal aomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiringvideotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. e was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter ChicagoDemocrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics ahigher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. e was also a post-racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.e is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to ""end the political strategy that has been based on division,"" to""turn the page"" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aidesjokingly referred to him as the ""black Jesus."" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to activelyfoment it. ""In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,"" he declared in  2009. During his campaignand his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the publicans voted as a bloc against hislegislation. e is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.is advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of""hope"" and ""change"" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In ameeting with congressional leaders last , senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama aordedequal blame to Democrats and publicans with his descriptions of the ""cynical politics in Washington."" Within the Whiteouse, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama ""brand."" Organizing for America, the administration's campaignorganization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing partiesacross the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as aniconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicianshave projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. e has remained ""the other"" that heaspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.The White ouse and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recountsin The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on WallStreet on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,Alter writes, ""Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confrontedwhile they remained in peril."" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, makingit far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recoveryand Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middleclass, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populistObama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance andprobably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the Americanpolitical psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like oover or Carter—or, more recently,presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.If Obama's politics leads to a publican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a publican presidentin 2012, then much of what Obama has aomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new publican president andCongress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public fundsand deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak orhostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial ProtectionAgency. form legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to comein; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.John B.

SidOr I could send the endless pieces on Obama and his troubles or aaretz on the new negotiations. I'll skip the torrent ofObama pieces (see Politico lead piece today, if you want to catch the full updraft of new conventional wisdom), but includeaaretz below from its editorial editor and Teddy Kollek's former spokesman:• ome• Print Edition• News• Published 01:58 23.08.10• Latest update 01:58 23.08.10ith a victory like this..The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinianshave preconditions - dictated by Israel.By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peaceTwo years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the oupied territories. The games were purportedly held ""withoutpreconditions,"" and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, toenter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that hehad decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.The illuminating movie ""Friendship Games,"" to be shown tonight on the Yes u channel (directed by Ram Levy, alongwith Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta awks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach tothe Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will jointhe other side. e tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinianteam. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not theconditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in EastJerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point wheretalks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after theAnnapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is draggingAbbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regardingbuilding in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held onthe basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, thenhe can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's suess in the negotiations, like the suess of the student team in thetournament, is not measured by the terms ""victory"" or ""defeat."" What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if itwas won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political processwith the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel'sapproach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs withanother unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll sueed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twistAbbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the TempleMount. ow many hours would such an agreement last?All we need is a few more ""victories"" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, ""without preconditions,"" andwe'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decidedthe time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite amas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranianpresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?This story is lojr:• kiva EldarAkiva Eldar is the chief political columnist and an editorial writer for aaretz. is columns also appear regularly in thea'aretz-erald Tribune edition.

Itmight have been early on, in 2009, when I visited aseries of gun shows in ruralCalifornia and Nevada. Perusingtables piled high with high-caliber semi-automatic weaponsand chatting with anyone in myvicinity, I heard urgent warningsof mass roundups, concentrationcamps, and a socialistgovernment in Washington.""These people that are purchasingthese guns are people that areworried about what's going on inthis country,"" a gun dealer toldme outside a show in no.""Good luck Obama,"" a young gunenthusiast remarked to me. ""Weoutnumber him 100 to 1."" At thistime, the Tea Party movementhad not even registered on thenational media's radar.In  2009, I led a paneldiscussion about this book insidean auditorium filled with nearly100 students and faculty at theUniversity of California-Riverside. Beside me sat JonathanWalton, an African-Americanprofessor of religious studies andprolific writer, and Mark Takano,an erudite, openly gay formerDemocratic congressionalcandidate and local communitycollege trustee. In the middle ofour discussion, a dozen Collegepublicans stormed the front ofthe stage with signs denouncingme as a ""left-wing hack"" while ahysterical young man leaped fromthe crowd, blowing kissesmockingly at Takano whileheckling Walton as a ""racist.""Afterward, university policeofficers insisted on escorting meto my ride after the right-wingheckler attempted to follow me ashe shouted threats.Who was this stalker? Just aconcerned citizen worried abouttaxes? is name was Ryan Sorbaand he was an operative of aheavily funded nationalconservative youth outfit, theIntercollegiate Studies Institute.Besides founding dozens ofpublican youth groups acrossthe country, Sorba has devoted anexceptional amount of energy tohis interest in homosexuals. isintellectual output consists of atract titled The Born Gay oax,arguing that homosexuality is atonce a curable disease and abogus trend manufactured byacademic leftists. Adding to hiscredentials, Sorba has a history ofrun-ins with the law, he explainedwhen I called him about theorder.My encounter with thisaggressive right-wing cadreseemed a strange, isolated event.But the hostility turned out to besymptomatic of the intensifyingcampaign to delegitimizePresident Obama and his allies inCongress. The Right's days ofrage were only beginning.Through his first year in office,Obama seemed oblivious to thethreat of the far right. ecampaigned against partisanship,declaring that there were ""no redstates"" and no ""conservativeAmerica."" Apparently, he thoughtit was merely a contrivance ormyth that there were people whorejected science, demonized gays,assailed minority and women'srights -- or that they genuinelybelieved in what they said.Speaking of changingWashington, Obama seemed tothink that the entire history ofpolitics since the rise of aganand the Right and their strategiesof polarization was not deeplyrooted but a superficial problemattributable to certain ""divisive""personalities, easily wiped awaywith gestures towardbipartisanship. is view of theparties was that they were simplymirror images sharingfundamental beliefs but separatedby ""partisans."" The skilled anddevoted community organizercould bring them together.Many of his supporters in themedia, often part and parcel ofpolitical wars over the years,reinforced and amplified hisinnocence, proclaiming he wasthe one at last who could ""bridge•the partisan divide."" AndrewSullivan, a disaffectedconservative who once calledcritics of George W. Bushpolicies ""fifth columnists"" butnow fervently supporting Obama,wrote that the new president wasdestined to become ""a liberalagan who can reuniteAmerica."" This optimismpervaded the Obama Whiteouse as the president and hisaides sought out publicanswilling to vote for his programs.After all, why couldn't we all justget along?In his autobiographical book TheAudacity of ope, Obamahighlighted a key component ofhis political strategy: ""I serve as ablank screen on which people ofvastly different political stripesproject their own views."" Once hewas elected, conservativesconcluded that they could reverseObama's strength by transforminghim into a human tableau for themost fearsome images they couldconjure.Obama's multiracial backgroundwas crucial in cultivatingresentment among the shocktroops. Those who rejectedObama's legitimacy to serve aspresident on the basis of hisbackground gave birth to the""Birther"" movement that soughtto challenge his citizenship. Themovement's most visible figure,and therefore the most eentric,was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-trained lawyer who hadimmigrated from the formerSoviet republican of Moldova toIsrael before settling in theconservative bastion of OrangeCounty, California. Convinced byclaims on the far-right Web siteWorldNetDaily that Obamaplanned to create a ""civiliannational security force,"" Taitztold me she ""realized that Obamawas another Stalin--it's a crossbetween Stalinist USSR anditler's Germany.""After becoming transfixed byonline conspiracy theoriesclaiming Obama's family hadforged his birth certificate inawaii, Taitz snapped intoaction. She filed a lawsuit in 2008 with CaliforniaSecretary of State Debra Bowendemanding an investigation intoObama's eligibility to serve aspresident. Taitz's plaintiff in thecase was Wiley Drake, an OrangeCounty radio preacher and formersecond vice president of theSouthern Baptist Convention whoonce publicly prayed for Obama'sdeath. While her lawsuit wentnowhere, and subsequent suitsearned her angry rebukes fromjudges, Taitz became an instantmedia sensation, deliveringheavily aented screeds againstObama before friendlyinterviewers from Sean aimityto CNN's Lou Dobbs, who Taitzcalled her ""greatest supporter""and who was eventually fired asan indirect result of his hosting ofher.In  2009, Texas p.Randy Neugebauer signed on to aBirther bill proposing that futurepresidential candidates mustprove their citizenship beforebecoming eligible to campaign.The Birther movement had foundits voice in goverment and madean indelible impact on thepublican grassroots. By 2009, 28 percent of publicanrespondents to a Kos/search2000 poll said they thoughtObama wasn't born in the UnitedStates, while 30 percent ""weren'tsure."" ""Obama should be in theBig ouse,"" Taitz shrieked to me,""not the White ouse!""When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first majorinitiative of his administration,the conservative movementactivated a campaign ofdemonization -- transformationalpolitics -- designed to turn Obamainto the ""Other,"" making himseem as unfamiliar, and thereforeas threatening, as possible. Whenthe president urged the Congressto deliver a health care reform billin 2009, the Right staged a livingtheater of political hatred,Obama's dream of bipartisanshiptransformed into a nightmarishversion of ""Marat/Sade."" On 12, 2009, tens ofthousands of far-right activistsbelonging to a looseconfederation of anti-governmentgroups called the Tea PartyPatriots converged onWashington's National Mall for agiant protest against the Obamahealth care plan. The date wassignificant: Fox News's top-ranked talk show host GlennBeck had declared the birth of the""9-12 Project"" to restore the senseof unity -- and siege mentality --that Americans experienced on 11, 2001. But thistime, Obama -- not Osama -- wasthe enemy.While covering the rally, Iwitnessed sign after signdeclaring Obama a greater dangerto America's security than al-Qaida; demonstrators held imagesthat juxtaposed Obama's facewith images of evildoers fromitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;others carried signs questioningObama's status as a U.S. citizen.""We can fight al-Qaida, we can'tkill Obama,"" said an agingdemonstrator. Another told me,""Obama is the biggest Nazi in theworld,"" pointing to placards hehad fashioned depicting Obamaand ouse Majority LeaderNancy Pelosi in SS outfits.Aording to another activist,Obama's agenda was similar toitler's: ""itler took over thebanking industry, did he not? Anditler had his own personal secretservice police. [The community-organizing group] ACORN is anextension of that.""The seemingly incongruous TeaParty propaganda recalled signswaved by right-wing Jewishsettlers during rallies againstIsraeli Prime Minister YitzhakRabin and his support of thepeace process, portraying him asan SS officer and as the Frenchcollaborator Marshall Petain. In1995, amid the provocativeatmosphere, a young right-wingJewish zealot assassinated Rabin.The Israeli tragedy was acautionary example of targetedhatred leading to violence.Members of the Tea Party""Patriots"" did not seem to carethat their rhetoric was irrational,or that comparing Obama toitler and Stalin wascontradictory and obviouslyhyperbolic. Their motives wereentirely negative. By purginggovernment of the multiculturalevil that had seized powerthrough illicit means (severalactivists told me they believedACORN helped Obama steal theelection), they were convincedthat a mythical golden Americanyesteryear would return. Theyhad no interest in buildinganything new or even articulatingan agenda, much less discussingthe merits of policies. The TeaParty's primary concern wascultural purification -- freedomfrom, not freedom to. Against thedark image of the president andhis liberal allies, Tea Partyactivists defined themselves asthe children of light. The racialsubtext was always transparent.The Tea Party's strategy rested ona guerrilla campaign of chaos andsabotage designed not only tointimidate Democrats but also todisorient independent voters whomight have supported health carereform. The Tea Partiers wereconvinced this would be an easyfeat, since they believed themajority of the country was ontheir side -- that they representedthe ""al America."" At the 9-12rally Matt Kibbe, one of themarch organizers, told the crowdthat ABC News was reportingthat 1 million to 1.5 millionpeople were in attendance,something ABC denied, saying""ABCNews.com reported anapproximate figure of 60,000 to70,000 protesters."" Then Armeyled the crowd in a chant of""Freedom works! Freedomworks!"" Unknown to most of theTea Partiers, they were intoningthe name of a corporate-fundedBeltway advocacy group, not thebattle cry of Mel Gibson WilliamWallace in Braveheart.Contrary to its image as agrassroots movement mobilizedto stifle the machinations ofWashington elites, the Tea Partymovement was the creation of aconstellation of industry-fundedconservative groups with closepublican ties. The movement'sleading puppet-master was DickArmey, who directed resourcesand talking points to the TeaParty ""Patriots"" from hisWashington, D.C.-basedadvocacy group, FreedomWorks.Among the corporate clients ofArmey's lobbying firm, which hewas forced to leave as a result ofhis involvement in the TeaParties, was the pharmaceuticalgiant Bristol Myers Squibb, acompany with a clear interest indefeating health care reform.(Armey's other ""real American""clients included the Marxist terrorcult, People's Mojahedin of Iran,which received funding andassistance from Saddam usseinin order to launch terrorist strikesthroughout the 1990's againstIranian civilian targets.) Armeycollected a consulting fee of$250,000 directly fromFreedomWorks and $300,000from allied astroturf front groups.FreedomWorks paid out much ofits money to an assortment ofpublican political consultants.If Armey was the Tea Party king,Sarah PalM was eager to becrowned the Tea Party queen.Just days after Obama'sinauguration, Palin abruptly quither job as Alaskan governor tovie for the honor. PalM's motivesfor quitting became clear whenshe inked a lucrative deal to writeher political memoir GoingRogue, signed on as a regularcontributor to Fox News, andreceived $1 million an episode fora reality show on cable television,""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" PalM'sbook tour, which sent her throughMiddle America in a luxuriouslyoutfitted bus, resembled both apresidential campaign and atraveling carnival.Whether or not PalM intends torun for president, her growingmedia presence has magnified herinfluence within the publicanParty. Yet the ever-expandingPalin phenomenon was greetedwith hostility by publicanpoliticos desperately seeking toexpand the party's base after thedrubbing in 2008. FormerMcCain campaign manager SteveSchmidt warned that Palin'snomination in 2012 would be""catastrophic"" for the GOP. isdoomsday prediction was backedby an  Gallup pollrevealing her as one of the mostpolarizing and unpopular politicalfigures in the country with adisapproval rating of over 50percent. Unfortunately forSchmidt and other partypragmatists, those who approveof Palin represent the heartbeat ofthe publican Party, its mostfervent activists, and cannot bedissuaded from following her,even if she is leading the party offa cliff.A  2009 specialcongressional election in NewYork's heavily publican 23rddistrict was the first major test ofPalin's power. Along with aparade of nationally recognizedconservatives, Palin endorsedDoug offman, an unknown far-right third-party candidate closelyallied with the Tea Party, helpingto force a popular moderatepublican politician, DedeScozzafava, from the race. In theend, Palin's ideological purge inupstate New York led to animprobable Democratic victory,the first in that district in morethan 100 years. After the disasterPalin and her allies claimedvictory, insisting they had at leasthastened the purge ofideologically impure publicansfrom the party. She went on toendorse Rand Paul, the son ofright-wing libertarian p. RonPaul and a candidate inKentucky's GOP senatorialprimary, while Dick Cheney wentout of his way to endorse Rand'sregular publican opponent,Trey Grayson, the Kentuckysecretary of state.Following the Tea Party script ofavoiding social issues likeabortion and gay marriage inorder to obscure the largepresence of the Christian Rightwithin the movement's ranks, theself-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin recast herself as alibertarian concerned primarilywith issues of ""economicfreedom."" She claimed theDemocratic ""cap and trade"" planto limit carbon emissions wouldharm the livelihood of blue-collarworkers, and she assailed healthcare reform as a Trojan orse for""socialism"" (though she admittedher family ""used to hustle overthe border"" to take advantage ofCanada's single-payer health caresystem). But no Palin attack hadas much effect as the one sheblasted out on her Facebook pageclaiming the Obama health careplan included a provision for""death panels"" that wouldrecommend euthanasia forseverely ill patients like herDown syndrome-afflicted son,Trig. With the click of a button,Palin transformed the tone of thehealth care debate from rancorousto poisonous.The source of Palin's ""deathpanels"" smear was a practicedpropagandist, former New YorkLieutenant Governor BetsyMcCaughey. When President BillClinton introduced health carereform during his first term,McCaughey falsely claimed in anarticle published in the Newpublic and widely circulated bypublicans, that the plan wouldforce consumers to drop theirprivate plans and buy into thegovernment's program (the articlewould go on to win a NationalMagazine Award and then beretracted years later by the Newpublic's editors). Now she wasback in the spotlight, pushing arumor that would be voted by thenon-partisan fact-checking Website Politifact.com as ""the lie of2009."" McCaughey's latestinnuendo was boosted by the cultof political crank LyndonLaRouche, which mobilized topush the rumor into themainstream.In  2009, one of LaRouche'stop lieutenants publiclyconfronted Ezekiel Emanuel, theNational Institute of ealth'schief bioethicist and brother ofWhite ouse chief of staff RahmEmanuel, ausing him ofseeking to reintroduce itler's T-4 program to kill the handicappedthrough health care reform.""President Obama has put inplace a reform apparatus revivingthe euthanasia of itler Germanyin 1939, that began the genocidethere,"" LaRouche staffer AntonChaitkin charged. Soon,LaRouche's followers were onstreet corners around the countrywith posters depicting Obamawith a itler moustache. At atown hall forum on health carereform hosted by Democraticp. Barney Frank, a LaRouchefollower waved one of theObama-as-itler posters anddemanded, ""Why do you continueto support a Nazi policy, asObama has expressly supportedthis policy?""Two months later, after Palinwhispered the rumor onFacebook, prominentconservatives from formerSpeaker of the ouse NewtGingrich to ranking SenateFinance Committee memberCharles Grassley parroted herclaims before audiences ofindignant Tea Partiers. Not to beoutdone, Glenn Beck devoted anextended rant on his show to thereality of death panels. Echoingthe LaRouche cultists, Beckaused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""thedevaluing of human life, putting aprice on each individual."" ethundered, ""The death panel isnot a firing squad. Rationing isinevitable and they know it!""The death panel rumor served avariety of functions, all useful tothe movement, but not necessarilyto the publican Party. Mostimportantly, the rumor resonatedboth with hard-core libertarianswho resented the very existenceof the federal government andChristian Right activists whoviewed the legalization ofabortion as a slippery slope togovernment-sponsoredeuthanasia. The hysteria itengendered helped repair the riftexposed by the Terri Schiavocharade in 2005, when theevangelical conservative JamesDobson publicly clashed withArmey, the libertarian leader,over the right of the governmentto interfere in a private familymatter of life and death.The slurring of Obama as a sortof sleeper agent crypto-Muslimhelped bring the neoconservativesback into the fray. The new neo-con generation was led by DickCheney's daughter, Liz, whofounded an anti-Obama advocacygroup, Keep America Safe, byleveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN'sLarry King about the Birthermovement that was challengingObama's status as an Americancitizen, Liz Cheney remarked,""One of the reasons you seepeople so concerned about this ispeople are uncomfortable withhaving for the first time ever, Ithink, a president who seems soreluctant to defend the nationoverseas."" With the libertarians,Christian Right, and the neo-consseated around the same table,united in resentment of the alienpresident, the conservativemovement was whole again.The experiments in ""TerrorManagement Theory"" of SheldonSolomon, professor ofpsychology at Skidmore College,Jeff Greenberg, professor ofpsychologist at the Unviersity ofArizona, and m Pyszczynski,professor of psychology at theUniversity of Colorado, havedemonstrated the connectionbetween fear of death andintensification of conservativeattitudes. The findings helpexplain the effectiveness of thedeath panel rumor andinsinuations by conservativefigures that Obama was not trulyAmerican and somehowsympathetic to Islamic terrorists.Indeed, these seemingly irrationalsmears were guided by tacticalreasoning, calculated to agitatevoters with constant reminders oftheir own mortality. Whether ornot Independents responded, therhetoric of death kept the TeaParty crowd in a persistent stateof panic and rage, ensuring astanding army ready to fan out torallies and town halls at the firstsign of liberal malfeasance.Obama's first year in office wasmarked by more than raucousprotests; there were severaldisturbing murders committed byfar-right extremists. In 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Naziwannabe named RichardPoplawsi mowed down a SWATteam of Pittsburgh cops, killingthree. Poplawski's best friend toldreporters the young killer ""grewangry recently over fears Obamawould outlaw guns."" Later it wasdiscovered that Poplawski hadposted a video clip to a neo-NaziWeb site portraying Fox's GlennBeck contemplating the existenceof concentration camps. (After acharacteristically thoroughinvestigation, Beck concededthey were not real.) On anotheroasion, the killer posted a videopromoting Tea Party rallies. Amonth after the Pittsburghbloodbath, Scott Roeder, asupporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation scue,shot Dr. George Tiller to deathwhile he prayed at his church inWichita, Kansas. Tiller wasdeclared fair game by the anti-abortion movement because ofhis role as Kansas's only late-termabortion provider. During at least28 episodes of Bill O'illy's""O'illy Factor,"" O'illy hadreferred to Tiller as ""Tiller thebaby killer,"" a criminal guilty of""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want tobe [Tiller] if there is a JudgmentDay,"" O'illy proclaimed.In  2009, a middle-agedprofessional named GeorgeSodini walked into a health clubin suburban Pittsburgh andgunned down three women. Themainstream press explainedSodini's motives away by homingin on passages in his onlinediaries describing his loneliness,inability to convince women tohave sex with him, and descentinto chronic masturbation. Nearlyevery major media outlet omittedor ignored a long deranged entryin which Sodini projected hissexual frustration onto Obama,whom he seemed to view as asymbol of black male virility andpredation.The day after Obama's electionvictory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luckto Obama! e will be suessful.The liberal media LOVES him.Amerika has chosen The BlackMan. Good! In light of this I gotideas outside of Obama's plansfor the economy and such. ere itis: Every black man should get ayoung white girl ... Kinda areverse indentured servitudething. Every daddy know whenhe sends his little girl to college,she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Notmy little girl', daddy says! (Yeahright!!) Black dudes have thier[sic] choice of best white??[ellipses in original].""In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during theheight of the publicans'Whitewater investigation, Sodinirevealed that he had purchased abumper sticker reading, ""StopSocialism, Impeach Clinton,""from a National view ad. Ayear later, Sodini ranted on ananti-government militia site, ""Iam convinced that more drasticaction is required to bring thecountry back to the Constitutionalorder that it was 200 years ago. Idon't think any group of politicalleaders will achieve this for us.""Whether or not Sodini's murderspree was motivated by hispolitical passions, he waspathologically death-driven andfixated on the phantasmagoria ofright-wing imagery. In his finaldiary entry, Sodini proclaimed,""Death lives!""More than any other media figureof the Obama era, Glenn Beckencouraged the campaign ofracial demonization andconspiracy that consumed the TeaParty ""Patriots."" During abroadcast of ""Fox and Friends,""Beck opined that Obama ""hasexposed himself over and overand over again as a guy who has adeep-seated hatred for whitepeople, or the white culture."" Asevidence, Beck pointed to Whiteouse green-jobs czar Van Jones,an African American formercommunity organizer who waseventually forced to resign as adirect result of Beck's crusade. there, Beck targeted anotherblack Obama adviser, ValerieJarrett, highlighting her ties toACORN while upholding her andJones as evidence of Obama's""socialist"" agenda. In anotherbroadcast, Beck played an audioclip of unidentified AfricanAmericans referring to ""Obamamoney"" as they collected welfarechecks in Detroit. Then heshowed footage of members of aKansas City-based youth grouppracticing a step show, atraditional African-Americangroup dance apparentlyunfamiliar enough to Beck andhis transfixed audience that hefelt at liberty to claim the footageas evidence that ""Obama's SS""was being trained across inner-city America.In  2009, Beckrelentlessly targeted ACORN, theRight's new favorite hobgoblin,admitting that he intended to usethe poor people's advocacy groupto distract his viewers from thehealth care debate. ""Trust me,""Beck said, ""Everybody now saysthey're going to be talking abouthealth care. I don't think so."" (isstatement was reminiscent ofRush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during theearly Clinton administration:""Whitewater is about healthcare."") Beck promptly cued up aseries of hidden camera videosshot by conservative youthactivists James O'Keefe andannah Giles inside ACORNfield offices. In the videos,O'Keefe baited African-Americanstaffers into making statementsexplaining that Giles, whoclaimed she was a prostitute,could obtain low-income housing.O'Keefe edited in images ofhimself clad in an outlandishpimp costume to create theimpression that he was dressedthat way during the meetings withACORN; however, Giles lateradmitted her partner had liedabout wearing his costume tofarther ineriminate ACORN. Inthe end. ACORN was exoneratedof all criminal wrongdoing whilein a separate incident O'Keefewas arrested and charged with afederal crime after he and severalconservative pals disguisedthemselves as telephonerepairmen and attempted towiretap phone lines in the officeof Senator Mary 'Landrieu ofLouisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,O'Keefe and his posse weremovement cadres paid anddirected by well-fundedconservative outfits; O'Keefe hadbeen trained by the LeadershipInstitute, the right-wing youthFroup that nurtured leadinG, lightslike Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,Ralph ed, and Jeff Gannon.While O'Keefe and his buddiesplea-bargained with prosecutors,Beck basked in his formula forsuess. is show earned thehithest ratings at Fox News,topping network franchises likeO'illy and Sean annity. In theprocess. Beck's opinions becamefirmly implanted in the nervoussystems of Tea Party activists.""Glenn Beck has taught useverything we know,"" ademonstrator at the 9-12 rally toldMe. ""e's opened our eyes to somuch.""But unlike the right-wing radiowarhorses who helped usher inNewt Gin<trich's publicancounter-revolution of 1994, Beckwas not an authentic product ofthe movement. When RushLimbaugh first began dominatingthe AM airwaves, Beck wasmired in the world of mid-levelcommercial radio, deliveringcorny yarns about lesbians andcelebrity trash in hopes ofbecoming the next oward Stem.By night, as he has tirelesslyrecounted, he medicated hisanxiety with cocaine and alcohol,destroying his first marriage inthe process. ""We rememberGlenn from the womanizing, thedrinking, the drugs. Everybodywho knew him at the time sawwhat a: complete mess he was,"" ashock jock from Tampa, Florida,who called himself Bubba theLove Sponge remarked to meduring a broadcast of hisnationally syndicated show.Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of EliaKazan's 1957 film, A Face in theCrowd. Beck was a self-destructive drifter Who mighthave been crumpled up with abottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in analleyway or been locked away in,a prison cell had fame not foundhim first. Beck was only able tostabilize his life when he madehis escape from freedom.,marrying a conservative Mormon,converting to her religion, andtransmuting his urge to abusedrugs into conservative radiodiatribes. When Beck first brokeinto television On CNN'seadline News Channel, hestruggled to articulate a coherentpolitical world view. If hedistinguished himself from otherbig-time conservative .hosts inany way, he did so throughstrained and often snide attemptsat humor, remnants of his failedradio career. Nevertheless, withhelp from his liberal agent,Matthew iltzik, Beck snagged aprimetime slot at Fox News inearly 2009. Around this sametime, Beck began promoting thework of an arcane Mormonconspiracy-peddler named W.Clean Skousen, whom hedescribed as his political lodestar.Suddenly, Beck had somethingmore to offer than irritable mentalgestures.Thanks to Beck's designation ofSkousen's pseudohistorical tractThe 5000 Year Leap as ""requiredreading"" on the Web site of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion ofthe book on his show, thepreviously obscure Skousen.became the idden imam of theTea Party movement. By thesummer of 2009, Skousen's Leapwas among the top 10 books onAmazon.com and a fixture onliterature tables at Tea Partygatherings. It went from selling apuny couple of thousand copies in2007 to selling over 200,000copies in 2009. Just why the bookgenerated such an instant appealis difficult to understand. It islittle more than a slapdash ofquotes from the FoundingFathers, often taken out ofcontext and deliberatelyoversimplified, to explain whyAmerica is the greatest nation inhistory. in the process, Skousenclaims that church and stateseparation is un-American, that""coercive taxation"" is communist,and that marriage is theunderpinning of a free society.Benjamin Franklin., who wrote atlength on the merits of ""amours""with ""old women,"" and whofamously solicited prostitutes andfathered a son of out of wedlock,was the ultimate authoritySkousen quoted on theimportance of marriage.Though Skousen claims theFounders as the world's foremostsource of eternal wisdom, hebuttressed his points with fringesources like the conspiracistNorman Dodd's screeds about theIlluminati. Aording. to Skousen,Dodd claimed that ""powerfulinfluences congregating in theUnited States"" like theRockefellers and the Rothschildshad forced the United States intoWorld War I. Skousen publishedDodd's manifestoes in his obscurejournal Freemen's Digest, whichhe founded for the expresspurpose of propagatingconspiracies.Skousen's paranoid politics werean outgrowth of his participation.in extreme anti-communistgroups during the 1950s. eboasted of a close friendship withthen-FBI director J. Edgaroover and said he provided himwith research on communistplots, claims disputed by FBIhistorians. (During a recentinterview. Skousen's son, Paul,told me that contrary to rumors ofoover's cross-dressing andhomosexual dalliances, he wouldset the top cop up on blind dateswith live women.) Skousen wasfired from his job as Salt LakeCity's police chief for, in thewords of the city's conservativeMormon mayor, ""conduct[ing]hi.s office as chief of police inexactly the same manner in whichthe communists operate theirgovernment.""  there,Skousen sailed off to the farshores of the Right-peddlingconspiracy tracts like The NakedCommunist-, and earningcondemnation from his belovedFBI, which aused him in aninternal memo of ""promoting[his] own anti-communism forobvious financial purposes.""Skousen's vocal support for thefar-right John Birch Society'sclaim that communists controlledPresident Dwight Eisenhowercost him the support of thecorporate backers who had paidfor his d-bashing lecture tours.e went off the radar for severalyears, returning during the late1960s to ause the JewishRothschild family of secretlybankrolling everyone from oChi Minh to the civil rights.movement. By the late 1970s,even the Church of Latter DaySaints distanced itself fromSkousen and his conspiracytheories. is work fell throughthe margins and might havedisappeared entirely had Beck notrevived it, turning The 5000 YearLeap into the bible of the TeaParty movement. JournalistAlexander Zaitchik observed inhis authoritative profile ofSkousen on Salon.com thatSkousen's renewed influencethrough Beck and the Tea Party'suggests that the modern base ofthe publican Party is headed toa very strange place.""Besides influencing Beck,Skousen's teachings inspired oneof the Tea Party movement's mostvisible grassroots celebrities,retired Sheriff Richard Mack. Imet Mack in  at a far-right rally just outside ofMontgomery, Alabama. On amakeshift stage towed into themiddle of a rodeo arena by apickup truck, Mack recalled withreverence his mentorship bySkousen, who he said taught himeverything he needed to knowabout the Constitution. Mackurged his spellbound audience tostockpile ammo and store food.""If you control the food supply,""Mack warned, ""you control thepeople. And that's the first step toslavery.""Already a hero to conservativesfor suessfully suing the Clintonadministration over the provisionin the Brady andgun ViolencePrevention Act requiring lawenforcement to conduct criminalbackground checks of gunpurchasers, Mack reemerged inthe Obama era as the archetypallocal lawman who vowed to resistthe tyrannical federalgovernment. Along with a fewdozen former and active militaryand law enforcement personnel,Mack helped form a self-styledTea Party militia called theOathkeepers. Galvanized by theirfear of creeping socialism, theOathkeepers solemnly swore torefuse tyrannical federal orderssuch as cooperating with foreigntroops and forcing Americansinto concentration camps.Because the group's memberstrained for combat, the vow camewith suggestion of armedresistance.Besides Mack, the Oathkeepersattracted a coterie of militiamovement retreads into its ranks.The most well-established figurewas Mike Vanderboegh, alongtime militia fanatic whopublished a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy andTactics for a Militia Civil War,calling for sniper attacks on ""warcriminals, secret policemen, rats.""With Obama in office,Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wingblogs with renewed passion andsupported his efforts by cashingin the $1,300 in federal disabilitycompensation he received eachmonth.For all the energy the far rightexerted in its campaign tostrangle Obama's agenda, it was aDemocrat who posed the greatestthreat to the passage of healthcare reform. presentative BartStupak of Michigan had been inoffice since 1993, placing himamong the senior leadership ofthe so-called centrist Blue DogDemocrats. When health carereform was introduced inCongress, Stupak became theleader of an informal caucus ofanti-abortion Democrats, makinghim the de facto swing vote onthe ouse version of the bill. Byextension, Stupak was the pointman in the campaign to ensurethat the bill would not allowfederal funding for abortion forlow-income women.But after close consultation withleaders of the U.S. Conference ofCatholic Bishops, Stupak went astep further. e introduced adraconian amendment to blockwomen from paying for abortionsfrom even their own privateinsurance plans. The amendment,which passed the ouse but wasshut down in the Senate, becamea key sticking point in health carenegotiations. 'e's a big heronow in the pro-life community,""former Bush Catholic issuesadviser Deal udson told me in 2009. ""Thanks to him,this is the first time I canremember the pro-life Democratshaving any power."" the chagrin of thepublicans, Stupak entertainedoffers of compromise from theDemocratic leadership.Aording to udson, theCatholic Bishops were keen tosee health care reform pass, butonly if the bill contained a clearprovision forbidding patientsfrom spending federal money onabortion. Finally, in , afterpressure from ouse MajorityLeader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.aagreed to sign an executive orderforbidding the federal funding ofabortion. Stupak had beenmollified. Now he and his anti-abortion caucus pledged todeliver the swing votes theDemocrats needed to pass thebill. As soon as reports seeped outdeclaring the imminent passageof health care reform, majorright-wing blogs likedState.org churned out virulentdenunciations of Stupak, callinghim a traitor and sellout. The blogcomment sections filled up withdozens of diatribes referring toStupak in language previouslyreserved for Dr. George Tiller:""Bart the Baby-Killer.""On  20, thousands of TeaParty activists surrounded theCapitol's Longworth Building inexpectation of Obama's pep talkto the ouse Democrats and thehealth care vote. Democraticpresentative john Lewis, ahero of the civil rights movement,and presentative Barney Frank,the first openly gay member ofCongress, passed through thecrowd on their way inside theCapitol. Thsligger!"" a demonstratorbarked at Lewis. Another calledFrank a ""faggot,"" elicitinglaughter and cheers from nearbyprotesters. Meanwhile, as anotherAfrican-American Democrat,presentative Emanuel Cleaver,ascended the Capitol steps, aprotester who had been screamingat Lewis and Frank spat on hisface.With the demonstration carriedon into the night, cries of ""Killthe bill!'' drifted into calls forviolence. ""I would gladly standwith any of you men here andtake these fascists down,"" a manin camouflage battle dressuniform proclaimed in front of anamateur videographer, pointingtoward the Capitol. ""You haven'theard the last of me!""The next day, publicanmembers of Congress emergedfrom the Longworth Building tosalute the Tea Partiers. Thedemonstrators cheered wildly fortheir proxies on the inside.Finally, after hours ofimpassioned speeches on theouse floor, the bill passed. Butthe drama was hardly over.publican presentative JoePitts, an anti-abortion Catholicwho co-authored Stupak'soriginal amendment, demanded amotion to bring it back to thefloor for a vote, a transparentexercise in grandstanding thatwas certain to fail. In response,Stupak rushed to the podium witha stinging rebuke to Pitts and thepublicans. ""The motion tocommit does not support life,""Stupak declared. ""It is theDemocrats who have stood up....""eckling from the publicanside interrupted his statement. AsStupak looked around the ousechamber, p. RandyNeugebauer, a right-wingpublican from Texas whoopenly supported the Birthermovement, began shouting at himfrom the backbench, ""Babykiller!"" Other publicans joinedin, parroting base insults.While the publicans sank theirheads in defeat, some moremilitant devotees of the Tea Partymovement called for a right-wingKristallnacht. ""If you wish tosend a message that Pelosi andher party cannot fail to hear,break their windows,""Vanderboegh of the Oathkeeperswrote on a far-right blog hoursafter the bill passed. ""Break themNOW. Break them and run tobreak again."" Within three days,windows and doors at DemocraticParty headquarters in New York,Kansas and Arizona had beenshattered.Meanwhile, at least 10Democratic members of Congressreported receiving death threats.Images of nooses were faxed tothe offices of Stupak and JamesClyburn, an African-Americancongressman from SouthCarolina. presentative AnthonyWeiner, an especially vocalproponent of health care reform,received a menacing letter filledwith white powder. The brotherof presentative rn Perriello,another health care supporter, hadhis home gas line deliberatelysabotaged after a local Tea Partyorganizer posted his addressonline (he had meant to post thecongressman's) and encouragedactivists to ""drop by"" to expresstheir anger about Perriello'srecent vote. In Tucson, Arizona,the windows of Democraticpresentative GabrielleGiffbrds' office were shattered byshots from a pellet gun. And abrick was thrown through thewindow of presentative LouiseSlaughter's office in New York asher voicemail filled with threatsof impending sniper attacks.After the Passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floatedinto a gray zone betweenauthoritarianism and anarchy.Crusading to restore a holy socialorder, they promoted disorder.Claiming to protect democracy,they smashed windows of electedrepresentatives. Warning of deathpanels, they called in deaththreats. With the atmosphere ofviolence thickening, Palin took toher Twitter aount to issue abattle cry: ""Don't treat,Instead—RELOAD!""

5842,5843,3132,191,46.0,133,3,1,3,"Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over thepast several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as theneed for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. Butthe more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward inorder to maximize chances of diplomatic suess.I. . State of PlayAs the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a seriesof tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning todirect talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well asexisting substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacleswill have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have beenresolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.a. ow to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium?b. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matterbetween the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) thatcovers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)that outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clintonparameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement ofprinciples?c. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be presentin all meetings? Will Netanyahu aept that? Is there an argument forallowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, atleast for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?d. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should itpresent bridging proposals and, if so, when?e. ow much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with thedirect talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and theU.S. and Israel on the other?Beyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely toremain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand howdifficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;how fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we everreach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does notknow himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt theurgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.Assuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines aeptable to thePalestinians, this will not our solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom helikes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver.Rather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S.administration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of theagreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security andinternational recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S.help, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically.Getting Bibi to aept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Otherbasic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israelipublic and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal withoutwhich Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But thepoint is that a prerequisite for a suessful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince theprime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- tomake the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, itwill be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians.2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which theU.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments ofthe domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoralreasons, but because the U.S.'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support fora deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has beenimproved to some extent as a result of the suessful  visit by Netanyahu and thestring of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest:there sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new,potentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeliprime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli primeminister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones.3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot byhimself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions,both Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whomthey would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-daynegotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players theyperceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the ClintonAdministration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role goingforward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement.The president faces a different but no less difficult problem. e is not trusted inIsrael and, though the  meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, nottrusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue whichreflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct hiseffectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned duringWJC's presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested innegotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expendthe political capital prematurely.  do so, moreover, would automatically be todevalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a wholeexcessively dependent on his involvement.Your RoleUnder these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential andpotentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must bethe day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would notrecommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions Idescribed above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.Nor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy whichwould quickly depreciate your value.Rather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you couldfill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address theneed both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerablecredibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was preparedto deal substantively with Obama and with you).Your role would be twofold1.  serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status.  a largedegree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further exploredand he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably knowhis zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suitedto begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,how they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the endof the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needsare met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-levelU.S. official he trusts most. If you sueed in taking him into your confidence andwork with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understandingthat would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will requirebeing tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (themilitarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the JordanValley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point isthat without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what hehas to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere. repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel,reinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahuat periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.2.  help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among importantdomestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do sohere and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obamamust contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you wouldseek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on whatbenefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secureand recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to theconflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened internationallegitimacy.III. Potential Downsides and sponses1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeatedmeetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over thenature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. Thiswould be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line betweendiscussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details ofthat outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extractfrom Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements onthe Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty andminimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respectivenegotiators work out the details2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creatingthe sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besidespotentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests forthe reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remainingsomewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, thisprocess could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifyingit. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two ofyou will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions thatreflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger andclearer mandate than currently is the case.3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the mostsignificant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcomingsuessions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon whichwe most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head andhis heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be betteroff keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is onyour plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associatedwith a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) andbeing criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to theregion; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on thesettlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kindof involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement hasappeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployedwhen it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than inorder to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that hasserved you well.c. While one cannot by any means be confident of suess, I believe anagreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectivelyto bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historicalcompromise are outweighed by its benefits.d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in alllikelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in apeacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on thepeace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gonein smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and izbollah andthe U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regionalclimate."

Its revival is testimony to the increasedchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.In the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter aount under the name uriminzok, or ""our nation.""Both the Twitter and YouTube aounts are owned by a user named ""uriminzokkiri."" The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful unification of Korea, a propaganda agency inPyongyang.Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, ""It is clear that these aounts carry the samepropaganda as the North's official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.""The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korearesumed propaganda radio broadcasts in , when it aused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46sailors.North Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter andYouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outsideworld.)""YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,"" said Paik ak-soon, an analyst at SjongInstitute. ""But fundamentally, it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash outdesperately in the face of mounting international pressure.""During the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago,during the brief era of its ""sunshine policy"" of engaging the North, the South allowed its people aess to North KoreanWeb sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter aount, agovernment warning against ""illegal content"" pops up.These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their ownopinions about the totalitarian North.But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinkingof the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in theSouth.The Twitter aount, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of . But a fewYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.In one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized ""pro-North Korean youths"" who voted for the opposition in the  local elections, saying, ""If they like the North so much,they should go and live under Kim Jong-il.""The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a ""pro-American flunky"" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living ""mopping the floor of thePentagon.""Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the ""American imperialists"" because it was armedwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of ""self-reliance""; and because of a philosophicaltreatise written by Kim II-sung, the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994.""I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,"" said Yoo o-yeol,an expert on North Korea at Korea University here. ""People watch this for fun, not to be influenced."""

Go back to your proposalson revival of manufacturing sector, too. What is Bill's program on lm jobs you mentioned? If they won't listen, he shouldsimply do an op-ed. SidDoes Thomas Friedman ave to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get SoMany Things Wrong?Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy search in Washington, DC., 18  2010 04:04Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance tospeak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe thathe is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special aess to thesesenior economic policy makers.aders with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful thanwhat can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes theusual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and thepresent seriously wrong.Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China togive ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-terminvestments in new growth engines.""The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part dueto the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order tomaintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had alsotried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and othercountries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a largeand growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housingbubble) until just before the crash.There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected bythe Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to dowith our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Giventhe weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domesticproduction without borrowing from abroad.Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. e refers to businesses'reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal serve Board ChairmanBen Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctanceto hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet theirdemand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increasein hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still farshorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.Later he tells readers:""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, therise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads andiF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than everwhile spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidencewhatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand forless educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readersmight think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highlyeducated workers as well as less educated workers.Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. e insists:""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs thatcan pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs overtheir global competitors. There is no other way.""We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentileon the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredibleaomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. TheGermans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness andworker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,but its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germanyalways ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buyingits goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0percent rate.The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis inspite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack ofdemand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that theeconomy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence thatincreased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don'thave aess to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will becontrolled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that itwould have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he sueeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead."

5896,5897,3164,0,7.0,625,3,1,3,"sbwhoeop,  25, 2010 10:52 AMworth reading, even if you know the IntelB6: I'm sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece, how Mullah Omar was saved by ISI, for example, but the ideaof Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sidhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistaniNT aLOSEThe military and the mullahsWilliam DalrymplePublished 23  2010The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.It is proving a fatal alliance.It  have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief ofarmy staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.For a start, the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilianpoliticians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed""Mr 10 Per Cent""; he has now been upgraded to ""Mr 110 Per Cent""). This has led to discussion in army circles aboutwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is thisthreat, that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Times, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.""( know this isdefinitely being discussed,"" he said.Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: ""an extraordinarysituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it"", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.Kayani, a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continueto run the army, and by default Pakistan's foreign policy, until  2013.But Kayani's biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in  as the honouredguest of the Afghan president, amid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, whichhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,Karzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as amujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed ""Lion of Panjshir"". The Taliban, and their sponsors inthe ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.When I had dinner with him in Kabul in , he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai'sgovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train itspuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of directionby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, ""it means that Karzai is alreadyplanning for a post-American Afghanistan"". •It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of aommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-sponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin aqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtunsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,Pakistan's great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a toppriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11  2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly fromAfghanistan andIndia quickly filled the vacuum.  the ISI's horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstructionassistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliamentand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As GeneralStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, ""while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indianinfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures"".McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. ""Wehave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan,"" a foreignministry spokesman claimed in . Pakistan's military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emergingto the south, believes it would be suicide to aept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - apotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital""strategic depth"".Aording to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indiandiplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to riskPakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership underISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis, and hisclear intention to try to reach some aommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a majorstrategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadimovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamicgroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with theretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the indu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managedwith great effect from 1990 onwards).The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike amid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,once said to me: ""If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for alegitimate cause, why should we not support them?"" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the BerlinWall presented to him by the city's people for ""delivering the first blow"" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis inthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his ""retirement"".The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a tapedconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that Indiareleased in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their ""tooti"" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followedtheir own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders, buteven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence againstIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, somuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11  2001 despite Musharrafs publicpromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked onplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai'sregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabulonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. MullahMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb ofPashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.Gulbuddin ekmatyar, the leader of izb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freelyoutside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin aqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in NorthWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.By 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering thema few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistaniarmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agenciesconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raisedfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistanisupport, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returnedto their bases in Pakistan.At the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning theAfghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twicebombed - in  2008 and  2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the searchand Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died inthe blasts.The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in thedocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for uman Rights at arvard, basedon interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! ""orchestrates, sustains andstrongly influences"" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadershipcouncil, the Quetta Shura.Meanwhile, in the Punjab, afiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-iba, and the man believed to have beenbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. ""The powerfulwestern world is terrorising Muslims,"" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. ""We are being invaded, manipulatedand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in aordance with Islam. Infact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.""At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generousassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both themilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley andannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others inthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any membersof the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. ence the seizure in Karachi, in , of the Taliban second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded asinfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.Yet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, NorthWaziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: aqqani and ekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan'sfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groupsin Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chiefminister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in thePakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistaniestablishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.In their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties lastmonth, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has sueeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan andDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south, and here India is workingin conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian ""stans"". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,was despatched to Afghanistan in , and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-AmericanAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and azara north and the Pashtunsouth, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and armingthe north and Pakistan the south.As diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue toincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peacefulnorth, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of theBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5  was a direct result.In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation's history, it regarded home-grown Islamicmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In arecent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacksthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic andthe educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests inthe region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy anytime soon.William Dalrymple's ""Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India"" won the first Asia ouse Literary Award in and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury, £8.99)"

Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. owdifferent subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas,it was not. I noted on  4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: ""Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused."" A week later, I asked: ""as Barack Obama'spresidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They aretimes of great danger. day, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will ownit. day, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. day, it is in control of events; tomorrow,events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much."" This was right.The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector.But, as Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, had said: ""When markets overshoot, policymakers mustovershoot too"". Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.In consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared. With the Federal serve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction.True, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of theFed, and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, theunemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would alsohave meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round.The implication that the modest stimulus package of  2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread overseveral years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it arguesthat in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package.Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.A fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. Therecession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus.Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy suess. At the same time, theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat ofinflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative.So what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent publicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the samething — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and aepting them, so allowing the publicans to get the credit for their""yacht and mansion-led"" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Thosewho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.martin.wolf@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/martinwolfCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

Yet the report passed with little fanfare and even less media attention—like so many otheraspects of the president's remarkably pro-woman policy agenda.It's almost tragic how this agenda has fallen under the radar during Obama's first two years in office. Wehear too often about abortion's controversial role in the year-long health care negotiations—but notenough about other women-centered issues that, after being promoted by activists for years, have finallymade it into legislation. These go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The American investmentand covery Act dramatically expanded child care provisions and ead Start. The health cafe billcontained over $i billion to support nurses visiting new and expectant mothers at home, a program thatwomen's groups and economists alike have championed as a smart investment. An even bigger victory isthe CLASS Act, also part of the health care bill, which provides a basic cash benefit to people (oftenwomen) who are taking care of the elderly at home.Yet I can probably count on my hand the number of people, including women, who actually know aboutthese new laws. Amid the din of bad news about the economy and misinformation about health carereform, these policies don't stand a chance, sadly, of getting much media coverage. it doesn't help that theDemocrats haven't done enough to shine a public spotlight on them.But they could soon be lost in an even deeper abyss: The rampant individualism and free-marketfundamentalism support-ed by the publican Party, which seems on the 1.Drecipice of controlling -dieouse and possibly the Senate, could undo these initiatives entirely. What's more, the new publiicpmwave could mute the voice of women and their most important advocates on the national stage.The Ten Parties, fueled by wealthy multimillionaires, are running extreme candidates—includingwomen like Sharron Angie and Christine O'Donnell—who want to get rid of policies that help women themost. If the health care bill gets repealed, for instance, the new provisions for !ong-term care would go outthe window, making decades worth of advocacy work moot.But the Tea Parties threaten women in other ways, too. .ff the publicans take back the _ouse, theDemocratic Party will lose one of its most powerful women: Speaker Nanc,„' Pelosi, who currently has moreclout than any woman on the other side of the aisle, Meanwhile, publicans like Sarah Palin and Nikkialey will only gain political power—and, with that .power, attract more attention to their extreme views.If these publicans become the nation's loudest voices of seemingly strong women, that could portendfor a shift among younger women's allegiances toward the publican Party and its platform.Already, despite the stark realities about what publicans will likely take away from women once. they arein power, we are seeing rumbling of such a change: After forming the backbone of Democratic majoritiesfor years, working-class women are wobbling in theii support the the Obama administration. Aording toa fron. last week, while femaie college graduates savor Democratic overpublican control (56 percent to 36 percent), women With only some college or a vocational educationare running almost even k A • 'Perhaps, in their growing economic anxiety, this group of women wafits to throw out incumbents theyperceive have not sufficiently focused on their economic progress. But, of course, if the media paid moreattention to Obama's pro-woman agenda—and both advocates and policymakers did more to broadcastit—these key voters would know that the Democrats, not publicans, are the politicians who have theirinterests in mind.Democrats can't let this continue—they can't allow publicans to brand themselves as the party of strongfemale leaders, or allow women to gradually become a constituency of the right. That's why it's critical tohave standout women in the party. If Pelosi loses, is there a powerful enough Democratic woman tocompete with these publicans in the national spotlight? There's illary Clinton who, as Secretary ofState, has sent a powerful signal to the country and the world about the importance of female leadership inthe Obama administration, But, as a technically non-partisan international figure, illary won't be able todo public battle with the rising right,Perhaps a Governor Sink—if she wins—in Florida could be among a new class of strong female Democrats.The °barna administration would also do well to elevate v.,/onien in the exe.cutive branch and turn publicattention to those who are already there.In addition to •presenting women as the face of the patty, Democrats must focus on issues like long-termcare, child care, and equal pay, all of which could rise to the legislatle fore in the coming months.publicans will likely directly attack or cut beck investments in these initiatives. When this happens, theWhite ouse (and Democrats more broadly) would be wise to e.:;olain what ili niean for women if thesei •nitiatives are gutted or lost—and to fight tooth and nail to make s-a•.e that doesn't happen.If it doesn't take these steps, the Democratic Party could lose ts grasr on a cr3-ni‘al.

SidAlterNet / By Drew Westen,24 COMMENTSWhat Created the Populist Explosion and owDemocrats Can Avoid the Shrapnel in say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The only question at this point is how to mitigate thedamage when the bomb detonates in . 1, 2010LIKE TIS ARTICLE ?Join our mailing list:Sign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email.ftagiou,-b ialEffilgandwa ol§to PolilitN say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatilemixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how tomitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in .The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and whatthe ouse actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keepAmericans employed. The ""Obama trine"" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability tocontribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet thedemand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, andschools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century globaleconomy.  having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration totaxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, ""We don't have ashortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work."" That message resonates across the politicalspectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughestdeficit-cutting language the other side can muster.But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on ThisWeek several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually comedown -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measureswhose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your childrenare hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people whodid are once again making out like bandits.Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in , it ain't over 'til it's over. publicans are shootingthemselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see MiddleAmerica from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in  from theirs if theyunderstand the public mood and speak to it.What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment atwhat could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in thevast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and theirchildren's future.ow to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two ActsSo how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth andconciliation without the Truth Part• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great cession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.By  2008, upper middle class moderate publicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happeningto their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.• A publican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailoutwith no aountability. Unlike publicans, who would say ""no"" in a situation like this and let a Great cessionturn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that theseare Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcyof publican ideology.• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans arefrightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to ""government is the problem, not thesolution"" and a path back to economic recovery and security.• The White ouse refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position thatwe should ""look forward, not backward,"" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. Asconservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the publicans in Congress orPresident Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in fiveeither behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers whogambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and torepeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn'tsubside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in hisfirst year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,to co-lead American relief efforts in aiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but ifforced to, he would cite unnamed ""naysayers,"" ""Washington politics as usual,"" or ""Congress,"" which wascounterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White ouse implicit in thismessaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essentialwhen the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the besteducators to oupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, butnever repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attackedhim for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into officebecause of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrificeexcept our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, butappeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and hisparty were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid brandingby conservatives since Ronald agan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.• The White ouse and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention tostimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing whatthey learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting thepublicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert andwarning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might beneeded to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could startreturning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White ouse, thepresident chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent ofvoters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves publicans -- the lowest pointfor the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind ofdramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful thatthis new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new ""stimulus"" act will docauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by publicans as a mixture of pork and fat, andno one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was neveradequately crafted or sold.• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in thefuture, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in theexcesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the newpresident and Congress. (eading into , this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation theDemocrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the presidentnor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks thatreceived bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts butdon't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing creditcard debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.• Despite talk of aountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or eveninvestigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic ealth Care Plan• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at thesame time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1margin against the toughest arry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,as evident in a leaked memo by publican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb foropponents of reform, who would do well to aept some major elements of it.• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devisingany new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to ""sell"" health care without a narrative. (I wrote aboutthis in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses tostate where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether weshould have a ""public option"" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imaginethe support it might have received if it had been called instead ""the one health care plan the health insurancecompanies don't get to control""). Instead, the White ouse uses phrases such as ""bending the cost curve"" whileconservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as ""government takeover,"" ""a bureaucrat betweenyou and your doctor,"" and ""death panels.""• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which wouldexplain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White ouse once again offers a story withoutprotagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same publicans who fought against Medicare forseniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut SocialSecurity despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the ""serial bribery"" ofpublican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-likealternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent ofeven swing voters wanting it included in the bill.• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and thatgovernment can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that thebetter plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are ""Cadillacs"" that are going to betaxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anythingright and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the recordsupporting government or spending.• ""Government"" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approvalwith swing voters drops into the high thirties.• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude thatwhen in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to ""reassure""the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find thatreassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issuesneeded to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressivepositions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)• The White ouse starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterlyconfused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. Thepresident talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of familiestightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and ""clean coal"" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in aspeech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward forpassing ""No Latino Left Behind,"" while publicly objecting to the legislation.• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equalparts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, andincoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the centerdesperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why bothFDR and Ronald agan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized andbetrayed (if they're part of the ""professional left"") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't followpolitics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).• Capping it all off, the BP disaster ours two weeks after the president has adopted the ""drill here, drill now,"" ""allof the above"" position of the publican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfectopportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americansagainst big businesses and their lobbyists) with what publicans stand for; and connect the dots between whathappened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itselfon the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and controlinformation for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appearindistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.Where Do We Go from ere?So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely tovote in high numbers in ; a publican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; anda vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren'tgoing well.In  2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democratsmight lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the Americanpublic knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and theAmerican people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in bothhouses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change wasnecessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to thenew administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.-brand government because there's only one story out there now (agan's), and it's not one that supports aprogressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads thepublic to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throwanother one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the Whiteouse hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, andwhen he does, he does them well.The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in thegame. The answer is that we'd better try. aving recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talkabout deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles eel, particularly now -- there is little question that ifDemocrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,and speak to people's worries and 'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving , particularly when theiropponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals andfiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplateconservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And onissue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americansand small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill weshould have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the publicans -- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out ofwork by the publicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popularaid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and policeall over the country with publicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out ofthe bill the publicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked againstthem, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in thiscountry, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoidpaying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to areasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass thefirst badly need ""fix"" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say thiswas just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent whilecutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were soessential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate toprevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's nottoo late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the ouse and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that thevoice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats needto play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrativefrom what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- ""the publicans won't let us do it"" -- to anarrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice betweentwo well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what andwho led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. Thatnarrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue aseemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some keyelements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Streetis gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquentaboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us fromcompeting with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctionalinvestments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safefuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.Drew Westen, Ph.D., is Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory University, founder of Westen Strategies, andauthor of The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation."

The ship isscheduled to arrive in aiti later this week.Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter andlanding craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-reliefmissions on short notice.A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarkedaboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise,volunteers from the U.S. Public ealth Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical,dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America.Eight C-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two M-60 Knight awk helicopters and two amphibiouslanding craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies rangingfrom traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, theship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.disaster relief efforts when directed.Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, aiti, from  24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew providedmedical assistance to more than 4,000 aitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, anddelivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s.In  2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to aiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a suessionof storms (Fay, Gustav, anna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support,delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.###lated links:About Continuing Promise 2010:http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/factFiles.php?id=155Photo of USS Iwo Jima:http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/images/uploads/634159131775283089.jpgCLASSIFICAT1ON:"

Freeman, Jr. (USFS, t.)1  2010, Oslo, NorwayYou have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects forpeace in the oly Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially SaudiArabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis andPalestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo aords were a real step toward peace, not anotherdeceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the oly Land increasingly disturbsthe world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of Europeancolonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, bydegrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. Itstimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, theinteraction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It isincreasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in thiscontest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds inthe Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the MiddleEast thus affect much more than that region.Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involveparties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regionalsupport for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peaceprocess"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There arealternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role forpowers other than America in crafting peace in the oly Land.Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadathad opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinianleaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally othergovernments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that ofany other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily andto sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application ofinternational law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning Americansupport has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with thePalestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have broughtsuessive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a politicalframework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end oupation, pogroms, ethniccleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressiveconfinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestineremains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in theregion — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis forconflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran haspostured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.On rare oasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israelwith action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to concludearrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contemptof the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders havetimorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting Americanprotection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects andcitizens.Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embodyrighteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standardsgenerates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governmentsassociated with it.The perpetrators of the  11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for Americancomplicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protectionof Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attackincluded suspending its efforts to make peace in the oly Land as well as invading and oupying Afghanistan andIraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. Thearmed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and othercountries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They areechoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed ametastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as amenace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and Europeanxenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowersterrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoteddemagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recentillustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. Itrules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. e came intooffice committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. is first interview with the internationalmedia was with Arab satellite television. e reached out publicly and privately to Iran. e addressed the Turkishparliament with persuasive empathy. e traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkablyeloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. e made it clear that he understood the centrality of injusticesin the oly Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. e promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judiciousrecrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policychange anyone can detect, let alone believe inIt is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration'sstewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this twomonths from tomorrow, on the 2nd of . The situation in the oly Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas isonly part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes inthe situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.Let me begin with the ""peace process,"" a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the ObamaAdministration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and ""even-handed"" American search for peace in the oly Land was the price of U.S. aess and influence in the Middle East. Itprovided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as tostand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and theArabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, therehasn't been an American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a ""peaceprocess"" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peaceprocess"" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.Even when there was no ""peace process,"" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to theguileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but farfrom least — lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing of peace without therequirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave likemagicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from theirhomes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the oupied territories, and annexed a wideningswath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a ""peace process."" It'snot just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charadesjustifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the oupiedterritories. It ensures that they have media aess and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for Americanleaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamicworlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews areimpatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of thegovernment of Israel to trade land for it.Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions haveserved to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achievingit. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half ofrelentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks asthey first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washingtontomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their politicalauthority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize PresidentObama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — stillless to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process"" are more fundamental.The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulatesthat: ""The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereignstate."" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It hasno interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unboundby the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the ""Roadmap,"" or the premise of the ""two-statesolution.""The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli oupation can provide. But theauthority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on theirstanding in the oupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Itsauthority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retainspower by grace of the Israeli oupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empoweredby the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. e presides overa parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or hisadministration can now speak.So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating withthe mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened internationalcredibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who waspublicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel'scontinuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the ""peace process"" has alwayssneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a yearwas made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resultedfrom previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David aords of 1979. Many in this audience willrecall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if theinternational community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinianstate. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.Peace is a pattern of stability aeptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible toimpose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must aept it are excluded from it. This realitydirects our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems theseabsences create.Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — amas— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet theyhave nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements wereexplicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to aept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quicklyfinessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcileeither American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any aord. But the Palestinian diaspora will berepresented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talkstomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latestinstallment of the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate andalso a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way theUnited States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definitionevidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, andAmericans. begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace process"" have officially acknowledged orresponded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israelmake peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offendsArabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something wellbeyond pragmatic aommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East.  the Arabs, Americans now seemto be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, andthe manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion andaept peace?Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can aept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of ahomeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction ofPalestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is askingthem to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that theyrecognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateralexpansion at Palestinian expense.The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concernsabout Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures ofaeptance can help Israelis overcome their olocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met withincredulity.  most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelisand its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasementof Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts ofcarrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrouslyunpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element ofGeorge Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposedfollow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and otherArabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabichas two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in eitherEnglish or ebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place inbazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam eachother. Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle thattake place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process ofmufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. Itcalled for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded withintermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms onwhich a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomaticeffectiveness.  move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understandsthings and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of thereasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understandhow others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans arelong on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essentialmilitarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We haveforgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.I am not myself an ""Arabist,"" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in theAmerican diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding andempathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we sawas in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in ourMiddle East diplomacy.This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the oly Land and their implications forwhat must be done.In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeedEuropeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the oly Land.  my mind, these interests include -but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and aeptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the grossinjustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well asfriendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival ofanti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end tothe Israeli oupation and freedom for Palestinians.Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from oupation as well as self-determinationfor Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interestin ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensionswith the West that the conflict in the oly Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, asthey very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogueand the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mea and Medina — Saudi Arabia has longtranscended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of allsects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption ofreligious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensurefreedom of aess for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interestthat Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than isgenerally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not ourred reflectspathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. morrow's meetingmay well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage theachievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's thatothers become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but notexpecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.ere, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration washappy to organize the public relations for the Oslo aords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect themfrom subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protectedfrom Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can sueed.This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with mostAmericans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and endingthe stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the oly Land entails. I have only four suggestions topresent today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with theArabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for jointor parallel action on behalf of peace.Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less giftedthan most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab aess to the Israeli press. The Israeli media havepublished some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of itscontents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the ArabLeague declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of theArab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperationwith them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-ArabMuslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations withboth. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, awell-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials whoare empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians soas to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peacepartner for Israel by bringing Fatah, amas, and other factions together. On each oasion, Israel, with U.S. support, hasacted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unitygovernment to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strongdomestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to aomplish this. Under somecircumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of lawinternationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system hasserved to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have preventedthe application to the Israeli oupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rightsconventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced thecollective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of oupiedterritory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but illegal, the international community shouldfind a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exemptthemselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, bothas oupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally aountable internationally for its actions. If the UN GeneralAssembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrinkfrom working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the oly Land and beyondneed to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a betterchance for peace.Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Aept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UNSecurity Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conferenceoutside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement ina year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conferencewould consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiringIsrael to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, anddisinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face theconsequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of theinternational community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomaticconfrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefitimmensely from peace with the Palestinians.Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlementactivity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel'sactions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who aredetermined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin toalleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rageagainst injustice that incites terrorism.It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperationbetween Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been askedto set the stage for a discussion of this issue."

But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things thathe was not in a position to share:1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at greatcost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping itsunprecedented nature3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.So three points:1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview ourring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will betaken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, andcanceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israelimedia, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be,we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. Iunderstand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesn't mean you have toand second, you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to sayabout them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could haveforeseen before going so far down the road, and should have - which I don't think is fair or reflects well on you.Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant andexclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful thantomorrow's relative short and peaceful format.If you'd like to discuss I'm at my desk and available or can call you through Ops."

Whether the Democrats have the ability and will to execute is a separate subject: ""If it were done, when'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly..."" Making Boehner the GOP poster child should be systematic andrelentless. Tick, tock, another day gone. Sid 3, 2010Americans Most Likely to Favor GOPNewcomers for CongressThree in four believe influx of new members would improveCongressby Jeffrey M. JonesPRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a publican challenger. Given a choice offour hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer ""apublican who has not served in Congress."" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent overa newcomer.These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA day/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment forpublicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a publicancandidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardlessof party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.The fact that Americans who prefer a publican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voterswant both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washingtonexperience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the typeof experienced representatives now in Congress.One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and publicans to prefer publicancandidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versuschallengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,more Democrats will be defending ouse seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is inCongress to a Democrat who is not, and publicans are more likely to prefer a publican outside of Congress to onewho is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for publican non-incumbents.The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specificcandidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one publican and one Democraticcandidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for thepublican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americanssay the publican and 43% the Democrat.The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congresswould be changed for the better if ""most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members."" Only 14%think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting stronganti-incumbent sentiment.Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most memberswere turned out of office. owever, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of publicans versus 63% ofDemocrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems fromDemocrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.ImplicationsIn a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president andCongress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected inAmericans' preference for a publican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for inthis fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greaterseat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular."

We cd take on the critics directly and right up front andmake the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that requirebringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is theonly option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing aprofile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be broughttogether that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nationsare sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility formobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of ourhistory and our values. (ere is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in aworld of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing ondevelopment as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well asgovernments. This is our time.The speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solvingproblems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architectureof cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.AM"

JonesPRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA day/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the publicans in Congress would do a betterjob than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied onhealthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.The publicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically haveviewed the Democrats as superior.A similar USA day/Gallup poll conducted in  2006, just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's elections,highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the currentsurvey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual publican strengthslike terrorism and moral values.With publicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains incongressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the publicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past fiveweeks.The Economy Matters MostThe Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (alongwith government corruption) as extremely important.The publican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federalspending. Terrorism -- the issue on which publicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as veryimportant by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list.Bottom Linepublicans' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party's advantageous positioning headinginto the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the publicans the edge onthese issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing thecountry, or whether the ratings have more to do with the public's frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party'sperformance to date.The Democrats' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-starting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans' minds. That could be tough to do when, afternearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White ouse, Americans' opinions of the economyremain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks."

But Bill Clinton's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting toturn voters' heads in a way that Barack Obama's simply are not.Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama willface in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly differentalternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration.So far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. Thisweek alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that haveassisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on  night to assist the embattledarry id, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week.""Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,"" says Norm Ornstein, a political analystat the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""e has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobodyelse can do right now."" Mr Clinton's intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked ina tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point.At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government andhas talked of abolishing the Federal serve, as a ""radical with no record to back it up"". Mr Paul, who has never run forelected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""I am not sure I would trust aman who had sex with an intern,"" said Mr Paul. ""I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?""Mr Paul's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal thatourred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreignwars.""Bill Clinton's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,"" says Tad Devine, a veteranDemocratic operative. ""e is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people arefeeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.""In the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman,Mr Clinton on  came out punching. ferring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former presidentsaid: ""I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida tohave three.""Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, MrClinton added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking aboutpolitics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.""In contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from oneattack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, thepublican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative.More recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money intoattack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. ""This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point outhow disadvantaged the Democrats have been,"" says one consultant. ""But it isn't good politics at this late stage whenvoters clearly want to hear about the economy.""Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

This is both the right thing to do and getting goodpress where it counts. AMDear Friends and Colleagues:What if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called ""Implementation and Procurement form,""IPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directlythrough a country's own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administeredby local organizations who know best what their own communities need.Through IPR, USAID is putting President Obama's recent global development policy into action. The agencyhas set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that USassistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallelsystem as they've done in recent years. They've set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that arelaser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good.Photo: Local organizations distribute assistance after performing a needs assessment in Bihar, India.Ian Bray/OXFAM GBThis reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actorswill expose USAID's programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local changeagents—both inside and outside developing country governments—can we actually strengthen the hands ofpeople in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managingrisk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists weinterviewed said they want USAID to support their government's directly, because it would make it easier forthem to hold their governments aountable and prevent corruption.What does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries.And for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shownit is actively listening.Sincerely,The Aid Effectiveness Teamp.s.

Besidesproviding a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the oasion for the first public appearance inEurope by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrivalof Vargas Llosa, one of the world's foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutchmedia, the country's political class, and the royal family.Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-rightDutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With hisgathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the governmentmeets with him every  to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to thegovernment, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. Itis the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategyof the far-right in countries across the continent.Wilders' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. e has alsogenerated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilderspromised to hire scores of ""animal cops"" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in theonly country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about ourfurry friends. is stated goal is to end immigration not just to olland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech isonly for the ""Judeo-Christian"" community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance,instituting what he called a ""head rag tax"" on Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include the goosestepping neo-Nazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang,and a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the mostinfluential Islamophobe in the world.But does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has justpublished a book entitled ""De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van et Fascisme,"" or ""The Eternal turn of Fascism"" (I eagerly awaitits English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In thebook, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to thegenocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. e calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists ""one-and-one."" In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionaryfigures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spadea spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain theB6story will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen's book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies whilegenerating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as ""un-Dutch."" In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement iswelcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So theDutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemedto have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clearresonances of fascism in Wilders' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulatingthe terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able tosee the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen's indignation.The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-rightparties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa'sdifferences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. e is an ardent neo-liberal and reviles Latin populists like ugo Chavez and 011anta umala who advocate protectionism and industrialnationalization.Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy,particularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed toWestern civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to theMadrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by seculargroups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosadeclared in his speech that ""Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation,"" and has been harshly critical of the statein the past).During the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter offamed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel's ""vibrant democracy."" She was enthusiastically seconded by MitchellCohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that ""thedominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism."" I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over thealmost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberaltrend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that ""Geert Wilders and politicianslike him are not welcomed by Israelis.""Yet Wilders is one of Israel's most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claimsthat his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. ""Nowhere did I have the special feeling ofsolidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport,"" he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutchfinancial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. is closest allies lie within the extremist settlermovement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionistintelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel'smainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindlinghandful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights forequality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within theIsraeli political spectrum: ""The origin of terrorism is within Islam,"" Olmert declared this month.The pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenientpolitical tactic. Of course, saying you ""stand with Israel,"" as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself fromcharges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highestideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state— and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;they admire Israel's settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majorityabove all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgameof the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PMSilvio Berlusconi's control over 90 percent of the country's media, the government's deep seated corruption and the PrimeMinister's repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United Stateswas a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelistshad described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decidedthat our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatestblows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness trine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Actto the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that henever knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.During the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student askedwhether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa's address. I respondedthat it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practicethe second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago politicalscientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli oupation of Middle Eastern countriesand the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that oupation has little or nothing to dowith the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our timewas so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders aboutIslam's inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre hov thatsuicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.Next, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People's Party forFreedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his politicalcareer. e was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the ""paleocon"" charactersI've met while covering white nationalist conventions like American naissance.""Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90's with the idea of the 'good stranger,""Bolkstein declared. ""If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr.Wilders.""The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor PaulFrissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects ""the right to be fundamentalist."" Theother panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. AfterBolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call for banning the Quran, remarking that ""what he says about Islam is nonsense""because it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of ealth, chimed in.""It'snot nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours,"" Klink claimed.Then, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christianschools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders,entered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. ""I'm against all forms of religious teaching!"" he proudlyexclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. ""ow can you call yourself a liberal?"" Frissen asked with atone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.During question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the""ghost of neo-colonialism,"" which ""the African people never voted for."" She mentioned the exploitative deals forced ondeveloping countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein's role as a manager at Royal DutchShell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and onduras during the 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemlyhappened during Bo!stein's tenure in these places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, ""If these countries try to be self-sufficient it just doesn't work!""After the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They wereappalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. ""None of them knew the first thing about Islam,"" an Arab studentremarked. ""They couldn't even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe."" Ginwala added, ""ow can Bolksteintell me my country can't be self-sufficient? I come from India. It's one of the most diversified economies on the planet.""I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. owever, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke towere closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20-something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole lifein Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. e told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New YorkCity and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. ""Most of usaren't even religious,"" Muhammad said. ""When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. I'm like,is this guy serious?""But he did not underestimate Wilders' appeal. ""Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like it's carefullyplanned. e obviously knows what he's doing. And they let him get away with it,"" Muhammad remarked. ""Look, I'm just acitizen, I'm nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn't like, I'll be punished. Butwhen Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, moreand more people are voting for him."""

And they should continue to by exercising their right, speaking out andworking to change policies that affect us all.Illinois did not allow women to vote in presidential and local elections until 1913 and, aording tovotingwomen.org, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were the first three states to ratify the 19thAmendment on  10, 1919. the start, Illinois and its suburbs have been home to pioneering women. Libertyville's ClaraColby is listed as the first woman to vote, having cast a ballot for a new town hall while, papers at thetime reported, her husband stayed home to ""scrub clothes in the laundry.""There is Jane Addams, the Cedarville, III., native social worker and suffragist who founded Chicago'sull ouse and was one of the first women to win a Nobel Peace Prize.And Illinois has elected 14 female members of Congress. The first was Chicago publican WinnifredS. uck, only the third woman elected to Congress, just two years after the 19th Amendmentratification. uck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. publican Ruth annaMcCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to votein some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress. Democrat Emily Taft Douglas, an earlyleader of the League of Women Voters and an internationalist who was the wife of former U.S. Sen.Paul Douglas and a cousin to President William . Taft, beat isolationist publican Stephen Day in1945, aording to the Women in Congress website.In more recent times, Rockford publican Lynn Martin moved from Congress to Labor Secretaryand Chicago Democrat Carol Moseley Braun became the first black woman in the U.S. Senate. Now,of course, we also have Secretary of State illary Clinton, who hails from Park Ridge. In the suburbantrenches all along the way, women have been leading and agitating for change. Former Democraticstate p. Eugenia Chapman of Arlington eights is credited with helping start community colleges inIllinois. publican Giddy Dyer of insdale joined her in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment andalso passed DuPage County's first clean air ordinance. Chapman worked with publican Virginia B.Macdonald of Arlington eights to establish a women's center at arper College. And omit goes.Nice, you say, but big deal? Indeed, they were a big deal and, indeed, women shaping our lives stillare a big deal. Men, can you imagine your life without women? Women, can you imagine your lifewithout other women? American women have come a long way in 90 years and society is the betterfor it. Women vote in greater numbers than men and have for years, nationally and in Illinois. Theyvery well can and should vote, write laws, lead and play even more influential roles in what the next90 years, and beyond, may bring us all."

SidFinancial Times FT.cornA poisoned process holds little hopeBy David GardnerPublished:  25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated:  25 2010 22:46„As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, thepervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming — and with good reason.The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground — inparticular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of oupied Palestinian land — pull in the opposite direction topeace. ""We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,"" is how one Arab minister puts it, ""and here we goagain.""While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remainsthe continuing Israeli oupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Araband — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and ShimonPeres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace aords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was theoupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the oupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering ofcantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roadslinking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has nowtaken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege ofGaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.The main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peaceprocess and these — in Israeli parlance — ""facts on the ground"".At last month's White ouse summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangementinto a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader ""willing to take risks for peace"".But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in  last year, in response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denyingany legitimacy to Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words ""Palestinian state"" — but hesurrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.Indeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means bythem is different.The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartetmade up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states livingin peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps topreserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?e has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions onJerusalem. e wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung ""ideological"" ones and the 100-plus ""outposts""established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. is idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like asort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easilyclose difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist.While his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodoxparties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative.  befair, Israel's electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable —means lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choiceof partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.As risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires nextmonth and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and aroundJerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line withMr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel's eastern border.As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised inthe oupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped PalestinianAuthority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then amas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failedto marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as amas, as part of the 2007 Mea aord). There has to be an end to theoupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.The writer is international affairs editor""FT"" and ""Financial Times"" are trademarks of the Financial Times.

Another idea, don't know if it can be made to work: ow to introduce Israel entering the NPT and ending its nuclearambiguity, which is its state policy, but which itself is the model for Iran now. Can this issue be used profitably innegotiations, a wild card, as it were? Can options be developed on whether it can, how it might work, potential effect onpeace process? Israel's nuclear ambiguity policy is certainly a big issue coming given Iran. See below from aaretz today:• ome• Print Edition• Nt--3ws• Published 00:56 26.08.10• Latest update 00:56 26.08.10Interview / Why Israel should end its policy ofnuclear ambiguityAn interview with Avner Cohen, expert on nonproliferationissues and author of the forthcoming book ""The Worst-KeptSecret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb.""By Nia.tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel newsAvner Cohen is a senior fellow of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute ofInternational Studies. e is the author of ""Israel and the Bomb"" and the forthcoming ""The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel'sBargain with the Bomb.""Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,and why would that be good for Israel?""Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of acomprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not justanachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, itundermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among theresponsible states in this strategic field.""Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usuallymarginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •""Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the olocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.""In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more itwill be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on thenuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.""The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of thethreats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to lookas though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don'tbelieve this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.""Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demandsthat Israel disarm?""Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement withoutfirst doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israelhas its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.""What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms raceagainst Israel?""I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would beprepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as thoughthey were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. Ibelieve the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly andrealistically.""You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israelsupporters.""But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It caneven remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.""If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The internationalcommunity thus has another reason not to aept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclearweapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the lesspatience the world will have for Israel.""ow do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'""Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it isvery hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject moreopenly.""Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but thereis no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.""On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement byIsrael's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. e would talkabout the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, theseweapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detailregarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.""Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we aresinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. Thisis a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say somethingpositive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...""All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say.""You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as thequestion of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?""There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced anunaeptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli societyaepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.""Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to behandled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.Ambiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties onthis subject.""What's it like researching a topic nobody discusses?""When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could betouched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher's perspective, not fromthe standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.day I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.""• Print Page• Send to a friend.• Comments• Share• Text Size -1-1:• Follow us on Twitter• Become a aaretz.com Faceboolr friendThis story is by:• atasha Mozoovaya"

Sidhttp://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.htmlEurope's New Politics of Fearby Denis MacShane 16, 2010There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities fortheir nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In theNetherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in  on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. Inungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entireworld.""  the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Itsleaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 ungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest'sParliament.Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but toanyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in thefirst half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear isproducing the same toxic politics.The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a muchmore nationalist tone. is Socialist opponents had to aept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is beinghelped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—ungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to bepaid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give""primacy to ungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of ungarian voters. TheCzech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek polanek, after he attacked the Jewishorigins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist RadicalRight in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to thePolish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for ageneral hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics issuspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator o Pinochet,Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War IIwhen ""Jews apologize for killing Poles.""Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg aider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union heldVienna in a political quarantine until aider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewishcapital"" in language even aider didn't dare utter.So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking toappease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens livingand working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.htmlB6EitWhat a Tea Party Looks Like in EuropeMarine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-rightparty away from the fringe, and redefining French politics inthe process.by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher Dickey 05, 2010amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-duxMarine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)leads todayJean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoatefears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speakingto the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front partyfeasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" tauntingthe establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even theseyoungsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperamentnecessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is ourcamp's best candidate for 2012.""Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She'sexpected to win the contest for its leadership in , and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strongFrench nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's afresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, anew threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right andcast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which beganafter his election in 2007. e had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But inelections this past , Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. Sohe decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. e proposed takingcitizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""),booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. isabysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says.""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as acreature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. day, however, the Frontwants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine'srival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says.Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of themthe former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-outbetween Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantlyIslamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process oftrying to build a new coalition government.Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usualcaricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American rightis much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiersmore effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligationto help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to publicservices A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""aess for all tothe same level of health care.""Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks bycompeting factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in thefamily's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building wasbrought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politiciansent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.""That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidentialrace a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.With Barbie Nadeau in Rome"
6112,6113,38,0,22.0,653,3,1,3,"FYIThe Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.comWar on terror: Obama softened the language, buthardened Muslim heartsThe Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans' fear ofIslam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high.By Stuart Gottliebposted  14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDTNew aven, Conn. —One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America's rhetorical approachto the threat of terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. ""The language we use matters,"" President Obama told the Arabic satellite television stationAl Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like ""war on terrorism,"" ""radical Islam,"" and""jihadist.""The White ouse's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term ""Islamic terrorism"" with ""violent extremism.""The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism, which Mr. Obama believescontributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was ""at war with Islam."" Indeed, the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach tothe Muslim world to build ""a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest.""Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands ofextremists.Language change ineffectiveNow it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn't. The first, by theBrookings Institution in Washington, shows that between  2009 and  2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism inObama's approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as ""discouraged"" by the Obamapresidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.The second, by the Pew search Center, shows that in  2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five yearsearlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions(in 2002, it was 25 percent).These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity – anongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital– the counterproductive ""smoke 'em out"" rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point.But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility – and thus effectiveness – of the overallcounterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole.Rhetoric doesn't match policyWhen looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up thewar in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1,000 Muslim detainees in Guantanamo,Bagram, and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddledObama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements.The price of downplaying the threatA large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line tactics — the USA PatriotAct, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions the White ouse has consistently played down the threat, even in the face of a clear uptick interrorism activity.For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described the suspect as an ""isolated extremist,"" despite his ties to AlQaeda. And the administration's initial response to the failed  2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was tocall it a ""one-off' event. Attorney General Eric older stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plotswere unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public's trust. A Galluppoll released last month shows Americans favoring publicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49percent to 42 percent last fall.Time to reverse the trendObama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. is instincts to maintain aggressivetactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — thatoverstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White ouse can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric — which has not paiddividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid aounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.Stuart Gottlieb, a former foreign-policy adviser and speechwriter in the US Senate (1999-2003), is now director of policy studies at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. e's the editor of ""Debating Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Con filo ting Perspectives on Causes, Contexts, and sponses.""

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.Romney, uckabee, Palin and former ouse Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when publicanvoters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party'snomination in 2012.""The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, buthis weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain,"" said PeterA. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.""The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term isa roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34percent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deservesfour more years in the Oval Office.""In trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, whilethe president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. uckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, avirtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent.""At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially ageneric publican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while hegets 48 percent against Ms. Palin,"" said Brown. ""She is very unpopular among independents and although sherecently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.""""Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinionabout Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.""Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible publican candidates in 2012.She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the keyswing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.uckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S.ouse Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score.Obama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters.In a mythical publican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed byRomney with 18 percent, uckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6percent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. aley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.""The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point thepublicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,""said Brown.  8 - 15, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,424 registered voters nationwide, live by telephone,with a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys inPennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and the nation as a public service and forresearch.

6172,6173,3347,0,4.0,658,3,1,3,"For your  reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher.""Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The  for a gional Approach""By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin, 2010)Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regionalsettlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. is approach depends firston securing end-game ""deposits"" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they mightnot be willing to give at the onset, but that can be ""deposited"" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side iswilling to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included detailsabout Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromisesthe Palestinians would need to aept.Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return forfull Israeli withdrawal from the Golan eights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit toaddress the inclusion of amas and ezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end alllogistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility fordelivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out itscommitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.Aording to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at endingthe conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. Aording toMuasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once theU.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on thetable in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-building measures to move all sides toward the end game.AM"

GroupsBeginsBy MICAEL LUOIn what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic politicaloperative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to setup what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the publican-leaning outsidegroups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.Kathleen Kennedy wnsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children,has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremelynascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bellfortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who headsDyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer whogave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on  toset up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it willbe able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raisingconsultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one ofthe nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,aording to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtainedby The New York Times.Mr. Brock said that ""money is money,"" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the mediaspending would be apportioned aordingly.The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists toestablish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on theright as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giantcontributions on the left.Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction afterthe Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected politicalplayer, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Mattersumbrella.Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1million to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave morethan $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the ollywood producer Steve Bing.""My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollarsto these types of efforts,"" Mr. Brock said. ""They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this criticaltime.""There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to bemore heavily involved in the 2012 elections.White ouse officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward suchgroups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.The lack of disclosure among publican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year asspending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White ouse and to win back some ofwhat was lost in the ouse and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raisemoney if the option of offering anonymity is available.""It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,"" Mr. McKay said.Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.On , for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming gether, a Democratic fund-raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many ofwhom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.No one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up anorganization.Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank aount by the endof the first quarter of 2011.By way of comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in ouseraces this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-.The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusingon attacking vulnerable publicans in the Senate and the ouse, as a prelude to major spending in 2012."

6209,6210,3377,0,7.0,646,3,1,3,"sbwhoeor,  : Richard Medley has sent this around in his private newsletter. SidUS Election And The FedWelcome  The New (Old) World 19, 2010One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much moreconservative fiscal policy if the publicans take over. This is the most important question facing officialson both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of g form andealth Care form. All of that is going to change after . ere are the details.Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVEsnarkiness) two things should not be lost:1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda2. The President has lost control of implementing the g form and health carelegislation Congress pushed through.All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the publicans taking over theouse. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control ofspending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.Let's start with spending:The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the ouse. As wewrote nearly a week ago, ouse publican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to usthat they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This willbe one of the top publican priorities.Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. owever, even in the unlikely event the publicans donot take over the ouse the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last timemoney was formally appropriated).Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in , the Congress hasto pass a ""continuing resolution"" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuingresolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the newCongress (say  or ) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, butthat would be cutting it close and too cute.Because the new Congress - even if the publicans fail to take full control of the ouse - will bedominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it moremoderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it andtake the hit.In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan toslow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rulesrequires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levelsyou freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidalwave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting tosee one of those).The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws willaomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strikedown parts of the health care bill now under appeal.TE SENATEWhile everyone has written off publican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be onwhat the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.The point is how the US Senate will function in  2011 given its new membership. We got aglimpse of what this would look like when moderate publican Scott Brown was elected and the healthcare public option was panned and g form was trimmed around the edges.The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes andregulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easierTake a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn intooffice).While some of these candidates are replacing publican open seats, all of them are generally consideredmore conservative than their predecessors:1. ck (CO) - likely winner2. omey (PA) - likely winner3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner4. Ayotte (N) - likely winner5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner6. Portman (O) -likely winner7. Coats (IN) - likely winner8. Paul (KY) - likely winner9. Miller (AK) - likely winner10. Lee (UT) - likely winner11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner12. oeven (ND) - likely winner13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossupThere are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These racescontinue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:1. DeMint (SC)2. Coburn (OK)3. Inhofe (OK)4. McConnell (KY)5. Kyl (AZ)6. McCain (AZ)7. Thune (SD)8. Crapo (ID)9. Vitter (LA)10. Burr (NC)One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and publicans operated efficiently as aminority party with only 41 votes total. In , there will be at least 22 new and existing serious roadblocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The publican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for clotureimpossible on spending bills.Welcome to the new reality."

Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. LewisFaltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: takinga firm stand on how to end the conflict.An American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and therebychange the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America's strongest assets is theability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define thezone of negotiability.This does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guidethe parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for ""two states,"" but must now say moreabout what that means in practice.Even if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offsnecessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on ""borders and security,"" as many have proposed, is itself unlikelywithout Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for laterdiscussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongestwhen all the core issues are addressed.An American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a publicframework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert theimportance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts andmeetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement onthe peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program.A clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelentingonslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchorpresent-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future.Perhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question.At a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support acompromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations andguarantees; reiterate America's support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standingcommitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimateinterest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula.What would it take for American ideas to sueed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to 'pre-cook'this declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principleswould be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support.Thus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purposewould be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim atinfluencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need oursupport.Timing and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some timemust elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can beredirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate.A presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. Itshould be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and ourQuartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort.  maximize support from keymembers of Congress, the speech should our before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalematedparties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum ifour purpose is not to be undermined.The speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; forexample, progress in the Annapolis process.As for the substance, in its endorsement of a two-state solution and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, the ObamaAdministration has hinted that a Palestinian settlement should also aompany normalized relations between Israel andthe Arab states, putting a broader framing around what has traditionally been defined as a conflict between Israel andits immediate neighbors. The normalization piece of the puzzle should be more fully articulated as part of a new strategybased on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a longoverdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative.If the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is definedby as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of whatthey will never gain without one.Skeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under currentleaders, exposing them to withering domestic criticism. Others argue that it will galvanize obstructionists, not those whosupport compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost toAmerican prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapseof the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forcesthat seek to undermine, rather than promote peace.America can and must do more than limit itself to managing a conflict that has all too often upended our sharedinterests in peace and stability.ENDChester A.

Koch in 1996. e and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred milliondollars to right-wing causes.On  17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera ouse applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok thestage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David . Koch was being celebrated for hisgenerosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline KennedyOnassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch hadbought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominentphilanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,which now bears his name. e has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural istory, whose dinosaur wing isnamed for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Kochpledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. e is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize inthe city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty milliondollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. er officesaid that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it mighthave created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealthattacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company hasgrown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries inAlaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largestprivate company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, yearsago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars isexceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social servicesfor the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with thebrothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economysearch Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a reportidentifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastlyoutdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a hugenetwork of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns againstso many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center forPublic Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who hasspent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, politicalmanipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are theStandard Oil of our times.""few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization thatDavid Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the  4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defendingthe American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this oasion the audience was roused not by a,danceperformance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,warned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. Anadvertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""day, the voices of average Americans arebeing drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mentionof its corporate funders. The White ouse has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, ""What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought toyou by a bunch of oil billionaires.""In , 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, sayingthat Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities."".Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch orDavid Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York, ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No onerepresenting the tea party has ever even approached me.""At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans forProsperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the TeaParties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequentinterview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to givethem ""next-step training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she notedthat Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Ofwhat they do.""Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave itsBlogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On  14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama asthe ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonicpossession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress bestknown for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared, ""They don't want our children to know abouttheir rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obamawas ""the most radical President ever to oupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the governmenttaking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!"" As thecrowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory, or death!""Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before thefirst Tax Day protests, in , 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party TalkingPoints."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for""Taxpayer Tea Party gistration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. TheNorth Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in NorthCarolina.""The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. BruceBartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-basedthink tank that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and noIndians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has beentrying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time thereare Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are ""trying to shape and control andchannel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-A publican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""TheKoch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and thefrogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relationsexecutive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and MortimerZuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a publican who received campaign donations from David Koch,called him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of hispublic interests.""The publican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, "" call them under the radar is anunderstatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuffworks for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic politicalstrategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obamamovement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to illary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutchprinter who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemicalengineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, aording to family lore,America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to sueed at home, Kochfound work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regimeset up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch wasdeeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. e returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,Rock Island Oil & fining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had beendestroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the Soviets became astronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, inpart, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists haveinfiltrated both the Democrat and publican Parties."" e wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communistsin Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to takeover America,"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment ""a vicious racewar."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.""Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. erecalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting inAfrica, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound acrossfrom Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowedto join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favorback then,"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight, he made sure work oupied most of my spare time."" David Kochrecalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""e was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrongwith government,"" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine ason, and the author of ""Radicals forCapitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that biggovernment was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and Williamall earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventuallyassumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less suessful. Freddie went to arvard andstudied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. is father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. FredKoch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni atDeerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" e said, ""Youmight ask: ow does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started whenI was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them forten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, aording todiZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore inWichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It waspretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-scienceprofessor. e credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles isone of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a waywardintellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, andseeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZeregawrites, ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-marketideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von ayek, the author of ""The Road toSerfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. ayek'S belief inunfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supportershave championed his work. In , the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""TheRoad to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of theKochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch for thisinformation."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the statebut didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a diseasemasquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. BrianDoherty, of ason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"" and that the school was ""a tinyworld of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" Aording to diZerega, Charles supported the schoolfinancially, and even gave him money to take classes there.Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance fromFreddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, thecompany's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, theeconomist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked pastone another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.e bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literarymanuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-fivemillion dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads theinvestment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remainedin Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to NewYork City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. Afinancial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David, described byassociates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. e rented a yacht in the South ofFrance and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likenedto an ""East Coast version of ugh efher's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, andmore genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on whichthe brothers disagreed.As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics inAmerica. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major publicstep came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of theLibertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald agan from theright. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidentialslot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket'sslogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation thatlibertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The LibertarianParty platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wagelaws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., amore traditional conservative, called the movement ""Anarcho-talitarianism.""That , the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand ofpolitics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nasty,corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" Aording to Doherty'sbook, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochstold Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction ofAmerica, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch familyfoundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of whichthey direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, andlobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe CharitableFoundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an aountant, spentmore than twenty-eight million. The David . Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company'spolitical-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eightyper cent of it to publicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in politicalcontributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family membershave personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, DavidKoch was the biggest individual contributor to the publican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politicallyactive nonprofit groups.In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. Inthe nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for fundingright-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant ofAndrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-avt, a vice-president at theDemocratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personalfunds: ""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, theOpen Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generousprivate contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued thatSoros's giving is transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochshave given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into arationale for corporate self-interest. e said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitablefoundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the NationalCommittee for sponsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,concluding, ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact theprofit margin of Koch Industries.""The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push thecountry in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for umane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; andthe Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by theKochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch hasacknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things wedon't agree with, we withdraw funding.""he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo thatLewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwarmovement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interestcrusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fightback. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, ""respectable elementsof society""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists.  defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,• unified campaign to change public opinion.Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. "" bring aboutsocial change,"" he told Doherty, requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning ""from ideacreation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project,he admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. Aording to the'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. day Catohas more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by themainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it hasconsistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute,"" the Cato Institutetook out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts tostop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told methat ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climatescientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest awillingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails wentpublic, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquirieshave since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus onglobal warming. •Nevertheless, the controversy sueeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, moreAmericans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. TheKochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fosteringsuch doubt.In a 2002 memo, the publican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensusabout global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmentalreform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobao industry used effectively for years toforestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the eritage Foundation, whichhas argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes thepresentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by NancyPfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group'sboard.Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of""Merchants of Doubt,"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion onscience. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines,"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added,""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't besurprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it hasbeen, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern emisphere. ""TheEarth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,"" he said.n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up anotherthink tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-orientedideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch familyfoundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the MercatusCenter, a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,"" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,"" Stein noted. ""Virginia ishosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbyingoperation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of theClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. e appears to have supplanted EdCrane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles'smanagement philosophy, which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Suess,"" and trademarked under the nameMarket-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with thecompetitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision, virtueand talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he'sa genius. e's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing ofCharles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the MercatusCenter's purpose. e said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual rawmaterials into policy ""products.""The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of,"" and notedthat fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first byMercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles,"" and that the MercatusCenter does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University ofTexas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., andMercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center calledit ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to aneutral-sounding think tank,"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oilrefineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. TheE.P.A., she argued, had not taken into aount that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected thatif pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the courtfound that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion, thecourt ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the ConstitutionalAountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montanaranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for search on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch familyfoundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.deas don't happen on their own,"" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.""Throughout history, ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that thinktanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract thepublic's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but aording to the Center for Public Integrity it wassponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, ""was to takethese heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolentrevolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example ofnonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates."" Within a few years, thegroup had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,aording to one participant, were ""very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigatedtheir business and released a scathing report ausing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oilfrom Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-onemillion dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been aidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oilmeasurement is ""a very uncertain art."" defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soonopened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, withoutissuing criminal charges. Aording to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personallives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,the counsel to the Senate committee, said, ""These people have amassed such unaountable power!'.'By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind ofcorporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a suessful assault onClinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts ofwavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of'resources and effort—their employees, too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it, but I think I was probablytheir victim,"" he said.The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this madeit difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoffgroup, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When thePittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millionsof dollars in contributions into publican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,"" in order to evadecampaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads intwenty-six ouse races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or inpart by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given themoney, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll hadbeen involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was thefirst time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child ofa company run amok.""uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the JusticeDepartment filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as twohundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed tospend five million dollars on environmental projects.In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosionthat resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the finalmonths of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, forcovering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The companywas liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, includingthe falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases everbrought under the Clean Air Act."" e added, ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidaciesof George W. Bush and other publicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyedremarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which illary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offeredenormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, aording to astudy by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since2000.In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was aused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. Thegroup's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support forJohn Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan politicalpurposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Finkstarted a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who hadworked with Ralph ed, the evangelical leader and publican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biographydescribes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an evengreater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics, calledPhillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.Currently, its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement hasbeen intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's otherorganizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.In , 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss ofliberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That , Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives ata Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog dState.com, took the lectern,thanked David Koch, and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americansfor Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released areport claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author wasforced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund,"" andFox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans forProsperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, oftenguest-hosts for Limbaugh.)Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to bemore than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; atanother, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protestsoutside the Capitol, in , where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.Phillips was a featured speaker.Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at makingindustries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yardbarbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar, VanJones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who wouldbe hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conferenceon climate change, declaring, ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthyfamilies . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives fromAmericans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. Thepublican leadership in Congress, he said, ""couldn't have clone it without , when people went out on the streets. Itdiscouraged deal-makers""—publicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, theappearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollarweathervane,"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the ObamaAdministration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen.  is whatchanged it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.""As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphantAmericans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single publican senator was working withthe Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groupswere ausing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech, Koch said, ""Days like today bring to reality thevision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago."" e went on, ""We envisioned a massmovement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of lifestanding up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens arebeginning to see the same truths as we do."" .While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in governmentpower, the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman ugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense ofimperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, andsince the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message hasevidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before themidterm elections, in . Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonethelessplans to target some fifty ouse races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, andrunning ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewedby FrumForum.com this spring, said, ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion ofgovernment spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all."" e went on, ""Itlooks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" e suggested that the Kochs needed ""to getmore into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.""n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. e was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As hewas recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started afamily, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane andeveryone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've beenbusy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so e can have confidence in me.""Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-Presbyterian ospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns opkinsUniversity, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in ouston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National CancerAdvisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that DavidKoch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent theE.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concludedthat formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposedto higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel withinthe National Institutes of ealth to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictlycontrolled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and KochIndustries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulationsuntil more studies are completed.Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and usesit to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2billion pounds. Last , Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formalletter of protest to federal health authorities. e wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.. panel's conclusionthat formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the NationalCancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keepformaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental ealth Sciences, a division of the N.I.., toldme that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.Vested interests should not be on the board."" e 'went on, ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as towhether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""arold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which heused to run. e said that, at Sloan-Kettering, ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing wewouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobao."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said thathe was ""surprised.""he David . Koch all of uman Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural istory, is a multimediaexploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confrontedwith a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than itwas ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, ""UMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CANGING WORLD."" Themessage, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response toenvironmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CALLENGE,"" is it notedthat levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increasedramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible roleplayed by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The aompanying text says, ""Duringthe period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmospherefluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climatechange in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short, compact bodies"" or ""curved spines,""so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's  newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity,"" and concludes, ""Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure outhow to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by theSmithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted tobe seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to dealwith this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as ""one of thebest donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off."" e noted, ""1.don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate whatDavid Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. cently,President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, inAustin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down lawsprohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups withharmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said, ""They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans forProsperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even, he added, ""a big oil company."""

(I havesent some of those to your office). They include papers on security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes inIsrael and the territories, etc.I will deliver a set of those papers to your office on If it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in thegroup, or give you some names.A few observations following up our call this am.:(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don't think impossible. If Bibi can say he has securedunprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide toplay the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israelirelations. is opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be ""in the room"".(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. notan early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel eachother out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S.(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you orMitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has beenagreed, and to move things along. .(4) On the critical issue of security, I don't think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expectan IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitionalphase. Question is how long.(5) As you know, Abbas' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, Ithink he is genuinely committed to an agreement. e hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to beunreasonable. And in that event, I expect he will resign. is minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967.This is all tricky business, but I don't think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form ofstatesmanship for you to try.I am leaving on  for some foreign travel but can be reached through my office -- LaurauberSandy"

So let me sayit clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.""Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president andthe ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton GlobalInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocraticsolutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort torebuild aiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and hespent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.Meanwhile, illary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, anaolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin'stemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over theobjections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world'spoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment view a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this iswhat Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.74.

In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's ownquadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediateneeds posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistanstrategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving suess will be simple or easy,"" she toldthe Senate in .

She would sueed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served aschairwoman since 2006.""Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriationssubcommittee,"" Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable .When power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey forcommittee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn't mean oneautomatically takes over the chairmanship.But if Granger does sueed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for StateDepartment operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many otherthings. Those aounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking forspending cuts that don't have strong domestic constituencies.Last month, we identified Granger as one of 10 publicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress ifthe GOP won control of the ouse. Since then, we've received several e-mails from sources who had heard thatGranger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel.We've heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking publican on the panel, was eyeing thechairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside.(Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking publican on the subcommittee, was elected  night to become thejunior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.)So how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign opsappropriations bill? ere's what we reported in :Although [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.),she criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, ""We also face the continued concern inour own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt."" She'sa strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aidfunding in this dismal fiscal environment.Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over howto balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development.ere she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in , ""I want to be sure that we aren't increasing foreignaid at the expense of our troops."" er lack of support of international organizations was criticized by thegroup Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an ""F"" in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is alsoon board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as sheexplained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the StateDepartment's Millennium Challenge Corporation. ""We can't just give out money and say we will put upwith whatever you are doing,"" she said.The committee leadership assignments won't be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our ill sources report.But if Granger's bid is suessful, she'll be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still hasnot been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1.The stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a ""continuingresolution,"" expires in . The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass fullappropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. Thatwould leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.You are subscribed to email updates from The Cable Email delivery powered by Google stop receiving these emails, you may unsubscribe now.Google Inc., 20 West Kinzie, Chicago IL USA 60610"

(R-FL) defeated a bill  evening thatwould have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns aboutthe legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road thatthe °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the nextCongressional session.Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent yearsdeveloping and lobbying for the ""International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,"" whichthe ouse failed to pass in a vote . The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166voted against, because ouse Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under ""suspension of the rules."" Thisprocedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage ofrequiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several publicans. includingAppropriations Committee ranking publican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign lations Committee memberRoger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance ""to prevent the incidence of childmarriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legalempowerment of girls and women."" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-yearstrategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annualevaluation of countries' human rights practices.So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6""she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for notproviding an aounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The 'said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to2015.Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheetgDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementationprocedures that gave the legislation teeth. ""Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actualimplementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,""they wrote.gardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because ouse publican leadership had not come outagainst it. But about one hour before the vote, every publican ouse office received a message on the billfrom GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote ""no"" on the bill and encouraging allpublicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.""There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts tocombat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,"" the alert read.The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already; prohibited by what's known as the almenè"" which has been boiler plate language in appropriationsbills since 1973.Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,considering that publican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not havean impact on the abortion issue.p. Stephen Laurrette (R-O) - the publican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeatthe forced child marriage act in a floor speech . morning.""Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [p. Betty McCollum(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that arecoercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriageat the age of 12 and 13,"" Laurette said. ""Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work peoplehad to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a publican. I'm glad we beat their butt in theelection, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.""But it was too late for Laurette and other publicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the ouse and Ros-Lehtinen willcontrol the Foreign Affairs committee.The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failedin the ouse.-The action on the ouse floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.and girls around the world,"" Durbin said in a  statement. ""These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will bebrutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continuethis barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol ill.""For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just thisbill. They also saw publicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence AgainstWomen Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which wouldprevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.""Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the ouse floor, we're going to see a debatelike the one we just saw,"" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. ""It's hard to imagine how anydevelopment bills are going to pass in this environment.""The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State illary Clinton, who promised to elevatethe issue  when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development view. Shehas said that forced child marriage is ""a clear and unaeptable violation of human rights"", and that ""theDepartment of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse"".State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behindthe scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the administration wasnowhere to be found. In , the White ouse decided to waive all penalties under the Child SoldiersPrevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between theages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if currenttrends continue.!One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy view released  (?• :) isthe Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in SouthWaziristan in  2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other borderareas. owever, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgentgroups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador usain aggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan willengage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •artgani network (no relation), but only when there issufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that themission can be completed effectively.""Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as amodern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,"" aqqani said in an exclusiveinterview with The Cable. ""But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to suess.""aqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan inwhich domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in aposition to expand its war on the extremists now.""Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged indealing with flood relief work,"" he said. ""We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.""e also noted that ""there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,""and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on atimeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.""Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makesdecisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,"" aqqani said.In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position onattacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is beingunrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which have existed for decades., ""There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and donetheir way,"" another Pakistani government official said.; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much ofthe blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions suchas speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providingPakistan the means for large scale operations,"" the official said.The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support itswar against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterizeas the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems.""It's very simplistic to measure suess in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,"" one Pakistani official said.In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review , President Obama was diplomatic whendiscussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.""Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to allour countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We willcontinue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,"" said Obama. ""Nevertheless, progress has notcome fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their bordersmust be dealt with.""Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that therewas more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. andNATO-led mission in Afghanistan.""Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,"" she said. ""Theircalculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategicpartnership.""The White ouse recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. ""The bottom line is that Pakistan is a countrywhere we have little influence, little aess and little credibility,"" one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times.The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to itsclaim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time.""We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,"" the new U.S.Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. ""But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity oftheir military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.""But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. Butwhatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet itstimelines for making progress in Afghanistan.""Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and aosianiNetwork that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,""Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security.

Sidaary's omerun of a Speechby Tunku Varadarajan 8, 2010 I 12:16pmClinton speaks at the Council on Foreign lations  8, 2010 in Washington,,DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obamaadministration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her ""new American moment""—and why she'sbetter than her boss.Behold the illary trine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech morning by illary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign lations, was the first time we have beengiven an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereasher president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders thatAmerica is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared  that we are all living ""a new Americanmoment—a moment when our global leadership is essential."" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; therewas, instead, a promise that ""we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home andabroad.""What is so piquant here is not the fact that illary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that illarywould have made a much, much better president than Obama.Try this for size: ""The United States can, must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that, Clinton promised ""anew global architecture,"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which thisadministration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of Americanvalues, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""Xuman rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow ""the rules of the road"" in itsaspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolarworld, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.Clinton used phrases like ""American might,"" words that we are more austomed to hearing from publicans—wordsthat we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. ow refreshing, therefore, that she should reach intoa vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.illary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for ""good, old-fashioned diplomacy,"" andthere certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, itshould be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bitbigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premisethat America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first, of course, is ""economic power."" But it is herhailing of the second—America's ""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of stateis that they both understand who is president."" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain tobehold, that illary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that illary would have made a much,much better president than Obama.Tunku Varadarajan is a national affairs correspondent and writer at large for The Daily Beast. e is also the Virginiaobbs Carpenter Fellow in Journalism at Stanford's oover Institution and a professor at NYU's Stern Business School.e is a former assistant managing editor at The Wall Street Journal.

I have embedded comments in caps in text aftereach graph where relevant.TO: Anne-Marie SlaughterFROM: Melanne VerveerDATE:  4, 2010RE: Gender Integration in the QDDRThe Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is ""at the heart of the foreignpolicy of the United States."" Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies andprograms of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office ofGlobal Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and uman Rights whileretaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structuremisses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security,economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of thedepartment and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girlsare most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureaumakes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of theentire State Department.Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than locatedwithin one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateralrelationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and othernon-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, foodsecurity, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorousinstitutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy anddevelopment.In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the followingapproach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:Maintain visibility and focus on gender. tain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues whoreports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essentialpart of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of theUnited States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the StateDepartment and USAID. [DONE]Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend thefollowing structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional andfunctional bureaus responsible and aountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issueswould serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureausfor purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on genderIssues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau ongender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance EvaluationSystem). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and aountable for the mission's work on gender, toassign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on genderissues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy anddevelopment work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary.[TIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WIT SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY,MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTERS — CALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY OW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT APDAS JOB TAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN TE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGT TO BE IMPOSED TROUG TATPOSITION]Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation.

6438,6439,3530,0,113.0,683,3,4,3,"Post-Daley circus gets started earlyEasier to count those who aren't running than those who areBy Rick Pearson, al Dardick, Tribune reporters11:17 PM CDT,  8,2010The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began  with all of the promise of baseball's Opening Day —no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown.With or Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a suessor for the Feb. 22 city election, variouspolitical factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contendersfrom the pretenders.""There will be a lot of candidates,"" Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he wouldnot seek a seventh term. ""Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to becandidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here.""In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozenaldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone whowanted to listen about how they could be the city's next mayor.But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it's ""better to be looked over thanoverlooked"" — weren't limited to City all.In Washington, White ouse chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President BarackObama's political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and boltsreality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.""Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide,"" Mel! said. ""It takes a full-scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote.""Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a ""unifier"" and""can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city.""Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.""I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is goingto be fair to the African-American community,"" said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council's blackcaucus, which met in private at the otel Allegro across from City all.""For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city tosupport them ... Everyone has an opportunity.""At City all, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. p. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, saidit was ""critical"" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community'sinterests. But the council's black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improvingeducation, that prospective candidates should address.Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potentialcandidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.""If there's a ispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the ispanic vote,"" said Ald. DannySolis, 25th.""I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won't be a ispanic in the runoff,"" Solis said.""But then I think we can play a very important role"" in backing one of the remaining candidates.But such sentiments didn't deter one of the city's most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plansto run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement ""down theroad.""Mell and many others expect the field for the  city election will be too fragmented for any candidate toreach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-gettersproceed to an  5 runoff election.One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of thecampaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can bemeasured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the  primary, politicians routinely get double the number toensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed toensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the  runoff.""I'm getting a lot of calls about having lunch,"" said the committeeman. ""I've told them to call me back whenthey get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising.""Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when orarold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.""There's a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I've learned over the years to sit andlisten and see who can put the different coalitions together,"" said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward'sDemocratic committeeman. ""Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is theperson who is going to win.""While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn'theard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he'd like tobe mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley's announcement.Robert Gibbs, the White ouse press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuelto ""take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future.""But Axelrod, who previously served as Daley's political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decidedto leave the White ouse for a mayoral bid, ""the president will support that decision.""Saying mayors are ""larger than life personalities,"" Axelrod said Emanuel ""has that combination of skills andthat personality and mindset to be a suess if he chooses to go that route."""

Leader Is Tightly Bound to LobbyistsBy ERIC LIPTONWASINGTON — ouse Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatoryoverhaul when presentative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other publican leaders summoned more than 100 industrylobbyists to Capitol ill for a private strategy session.The bill's passage in the ouse already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Streetlobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least waterit down.""We need you to get out there and speak up against this,"" Mr. Boehner said that  afternoon, aording to threepeople familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usualfor Mr. Boehner, the ouse minority leader and would-be speaker if publicans win the ouse in . emaintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggestbusinesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. ynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on theircorporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts forhis Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides asoften as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helpedthem out.As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the publican Party — President Obamamentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on  as having met ""countless times withspecial-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation"" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he ""epitomizes thesmoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.""Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politicallymotivated by desperate Democrats. is actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy thathe has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a smallplastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.""I get lobbied every day by somebody,"" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. ""It could be by my wife. It could bethe bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.""Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as NewtGingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as m DeLay, two of his publican predecessors in top ouse posts. It is hisreputation as a ""Chamber of Commerce"" publican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million forpublican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.If elected as his party's leader in the ouse, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he buildscoalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. is friends say there is nothing wrongwith that.""Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,"" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose publican firmrepresents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverseas Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. ""But I think all the good lawmakers do.""Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobaolobbyists to fellow publicans on the ouse floor. Then the fourth-ranking ouse publican, Mr. Boehner said he hadbroken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other publicans' campaigns.is business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol ill nicknamed the Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party'slegislative agenda. The  gathering was disbanded after a publican power struggle that cost him his leadershipposition.But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and theWorkforce Committee, and returned to power as ouse G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime  regulars,along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, aCitigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.The tobao industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. ynolds,maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner'spolitical career, aording to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporateinterests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. is clique even has a nickname on Capitol ill, Boehner Land. Themembers of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open aess to him and his staff.""e likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,"" said Drew Maloney, alobbyist at Ogilvy Government lations. ""That is how you get things done.""One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oilindustry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a capon greenhouse gas emissions.Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.But despite the recent string of defeats on the ouse floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists. 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided bycompanies including R. J. ynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often topopular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top ouse beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently beencurbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid forthrough his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the RitzCarlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 atthe Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.In , with the prospects for a publican takeover of the ouse rising, Mr. Boehner moved to aelerate his fund-raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to drawlarge donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other ouse publicans.e turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a  meeting at the headquarters of thepublican National Committee.""The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,"" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. ""But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity becausewe have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.""Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raisednearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for publican ouse candidatesacross the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like ""meetings withLeader Boehner and much much more.""But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty ofaess to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the ouse.""e knows this is going to be a tough election,"" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clientsinclude Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. ""But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."""

It was Walter Isaacson.New BBG chief wants more money to combat ""enemies"" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin , 5, 2010 - 4:43 PMThe Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Timemagazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's""enemies,"" which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio FreeEurope, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at thesame time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress mustallow the U.S. government to do the same.""We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,"" he said. ""You've got Russia day, Iran's Press TV,Venezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel withcorrespondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol illwith that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.""Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that Chinaand Iran were the prime targets.""China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployedarmies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents,"" he said. ""The BBG is at the forefront of combatingthis. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway foraudiences in China and Iran.""""We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,"" Isaacson said. ""Wherever there is a firewall, it's our dutyto storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.""Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited ascontributing to the end of the Cold War. e made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.""It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it'stasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalisticstandards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by aurately conveying its policies and values to theworld,"" Isaacson said.""Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't doit unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.""Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administrationsought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn'thesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.e said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent ofthe time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.""I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in theprivate sector,"" Isaacson said. ""We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help furtherthe foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility."""

6567,6568,3618,0,4.0,700,3,1,3,"I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member, who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist andother places before she joined us in . She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreignlations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.By EMILY PARKERIn 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded todiscuss why he believes that literature can change the world.Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. is work isperhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.In a New public essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the lifeof nations."" e wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the bestprotector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the valueof individual liberty. e is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that heis among the most suessful.Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescuefirst from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, whichis when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. e told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe howdictatorships impregnate ""every act of life."" demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The bookopens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at thetables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps frompast to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in ""The Feast of the Goat,"" which explicitly details the horrors ofthe Trujillo regime in the Dominican public. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, andso we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. ""Thewoman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,"" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and hisoutspoken views. e unsuessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During thecampaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and privateproperty. e was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary toending what he called the ""monstrous dictatorship"" of Saddam ussein.Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or ashe told me in Lima: 'Through writing, one can change history.""Not all of his work is dark. ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"" is punctuated with humor, and 'The Bad Girl,"" aboutone man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is aperceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, ""Nothing better protects a human being againstthe stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truththat invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.""Ms. Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign lations."

6569,6570,3619,0,7.0,700,3,1,3,"sbwhoeo1, 0c3 10 4:08 PM: The Boehner poll. Sidraw WestenPsychologist and neuroscientist; Emory University ProfessorPosted:  8, 2010 09:23 AMdJnLM L t,-.-1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1Aording to news reports, today publican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his ""closingargument"" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-id ""job-killing agenda."" e will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venuethese days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooksand the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industrylobbyists.Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the publicansbelieve it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White ouse made an effort to put Boehner'sface on what a publican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehnerhas minimal name recognition among voters. But the White ouse was no doubt responding to three realities.First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most publicans in the news, he has notbeen well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something firstrather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking publican were the GOP to assumecontrol over the ouse (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street inWashington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other thanperhaps Sarah Palin, who publicans could alternately aept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tannedvisage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington(including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobao lobby campaign checks to his fellow publicans on thefloor of the ouse) made him a potential counter-villain to the publican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely votingpopulations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol andstandard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whetherwe looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a""likely voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to changethe dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readilystands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote forCongressional publicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swingvoters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence ofthose narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against:the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-id"" agenda.What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the ""job-killing"" socialists in the White ouseand Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actorgoing in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-longdescriptions of ""what's the matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservativeattack on the Obama-Pelosi-id axis of conservative evil.The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over toughpublican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Streetexecutives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking ofWashington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the politicalspectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Roveinto the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters.In some ways what was most surprising was the suess of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker andwho John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect thepower of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty andaspirational (e.g., ""We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans"" -- a themecolleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) --to the harder-edged (e.g., ""The Speaker of the ouse is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we knowwhere John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. e's spentnearly 20 years in Washington creating them."")If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats wantto hang onto their seats in , they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and smallbusiness versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster childfor the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoidgiving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say theystand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns onboth sides of the aisle.In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was thefailure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular thefailure to brand the Bush cession as the natural consequence of faded publican economic principles. Two years ago,that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White ouse andsupermajorities in both the ouse and Senate. day, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession.ality doesn't brand itself. opefully it won't take a debacle in  and another 10 million jobs lost for reality tounveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple."

SidWhy is This GOP ouse Candidate Dressed asa Nazi?By Joshua GreenAn election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, thepublican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a GermanWaffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devotedto re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on theEastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, andhis name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed hisinvolvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does notsubscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. Andyou'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.lott, a member of the Ohio Military serve, added, ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relativelysmall country that from a strictly military point of view aomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most ofEurope and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them.  a purely historical militarypoint of view, that's incredible.""lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the RussianArmy, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitmentvideo, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference tothe ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives toensure a ""New and Free Europe"", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -many in olland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as theprotector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quitetwisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. gardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant mendied defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; nomatter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular theforeign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.istorians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history,"" said CharlesW. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's ead Division, 1933-45,""which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what ourred."" Sydnor added that re-enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germanytoday, you'd be arrested.""See web-only content:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel ill, said, ""It is so unhistorical andso apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts wholove putting on uniforms.""loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as2003), but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" e says his name and pictures were removed from theWiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three yearsago, after his son lost interest.loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias ""inhard Pferdmann,"" which has also beenremoved, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience],"" lott said, ""is theliving-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many unitswhat individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of basedaround your own real experiences. 'inhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,""pferd' is a horse. So it'sliterally 'horse man.""Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said hehoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do CivilWar re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""0lott at Nazi re-enactment.Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of ledo that sits in the 9th district,disagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unaeptable andcertainly in poor taste, if not offensive,"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among theJewish community, but the broader community.""In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groupsbut made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never, in any of my reenacting ofmilitary history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by thetragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of themilitary and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" e added thathe has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War IIAmerican infantryman and paratrooper.The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death es ofungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,"" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiersfrom the Wiking division were involved in the killing of ungarian Jews in  and  1945, before surrendering toAmerican forces in Austria.""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally aused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,"" saysProf. Rob Citino, of the Military istory Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. ""Theentire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslavedin numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to beexterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think thatpeople want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""This article available online at:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/Copyright © 2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might behelpful in drafting a response.In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where theattacks oured in places where there was NO USG branding.

6648,6649,3648,0,7.0,703,3,1,3,"Did this with Sean. SidThe Political SceneConfounding FathersThe Tea Party's Cold War roots.by Sean Wilentz  18, 2010ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favoriteprops: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by thestem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""storing istory,"" andBeck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack ofhistory textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, heexplained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from ourhistory to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of thehistory that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved thenation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taughtone lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormonconvert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in  byDemocracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merelyas an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his owninstitute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; ope 102, an attack on the activistfederal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and thedivision of powers.During the ""storing istory"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of threemembers, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department atLouisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessonsabout the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of theearly twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal serve System andthe graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in , ""just despisedwhat America was.""Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's FreedomSummit in Washington last , one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and WoodrowWilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in  an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group fromCape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country todaystarted with the Wilson Administration.""At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""anunfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson isaudacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history ofconspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of Americanhistory—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and CommunistChina—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decadesinside the publican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing tochallenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racistviolence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in timedeliver the once solidly Democratic South to the publicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, whichclaimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered afearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when heresigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wingpropaganda among his troops and ausing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator StromThurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestlyliberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by RobertWelch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of theCold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy'sfollowers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership wasestimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tracttitled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communistconspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, heaused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do theopposite.""Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf oftotalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevikvolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably anenemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government'srole in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other oneman started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the totalconspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenthcentury, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" theconspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, governmentagencies like the Federal serve System and the Internal venue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like theBilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign lations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, theyhad done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which theseconspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivisttheories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of newand modern concepts.""In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment anonviolent political revolution would suffice. Aordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on theMarxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate thepopulace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but thecourage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen andprofessionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is mostdemanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's groupbecame synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kellyto the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made ahumorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. Atransplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the earlynineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar oover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file notedthat ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' whoare promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimedimplausibly, gave him aess to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that hehad served as oover's administrative assistant; oover informed inquirers that there was no such position.Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. is time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly cardgame attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of halftruths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on theor's lawn.After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as anexemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American OpinionSpeakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" whichcondemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he laterdefended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on theMormons."")All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primerpublished in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviserarry opkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the firstSputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose mindscould be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried theIvy League Establishment, who, through the Federal serve, the Council on Foreign lations, and the RockefellerFoundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers likethe wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) ouse, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place theFederal serve and the graduated income tax.In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center forConstitutional Studies. Aording to an article published in the view of ligious search, the center's targetsincluded ""the Oupational Safety and ealth Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the FederalCommunication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the goldstandard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, socialsecurity, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wingfringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""goneoff the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue aused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas andmaking inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilouslyclose"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign lationsand the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about hisorganizations.Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotationsand groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and thatthe framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, oftendescribed as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexanderamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervidbook. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils ofwhat Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution ofwealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. ThomasJefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country madea paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idlegesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the ConstitutionalConvention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was firstpermitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" asthe national motto.In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" andprepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informativestudy of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the CaliforniaBicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an aount of slavery drawn fromlong-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" andsuggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, ofStanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar wouldthink is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this public the way they did."" AfterBeck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousandcopies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the countryhave since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our FoundingFathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck isthe movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-level text.The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to anaudience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audiencethat socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and thatpatriotic Americans must take their country back. is TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beckdescribed perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. e attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federalserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaountable to the public); the Council on Foreignlations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel ouse and Welch's old target WoodrowWilson. is sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On  22nd, amid adiatribe about ouse, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal serve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerfulbankers established the Federal serve in service of their plot to dominate the world.Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawingof fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an oldMercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson wasthe President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt theancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptorAdolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustratethe desire for peace.Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, hewas not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating bigbusiness—looked back to Alexander amilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sentAmerican troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopoliesin order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""thenshe can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's eadline News, brought to his show a John Birch Societyspokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—Ithought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" isguest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's beenout there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last , an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck onCommunism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of Americanhistory.""Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture underPresident Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety fora speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in ourfight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last , Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John BirchSociety has been doing it for over 50 years.""Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservativepublicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada publican Senate candidate SharronAngle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the JohnBirch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggestedthat the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority inthe country."" There are signs that this is so: publicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" duringElena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by theminuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federalserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and biggovernment generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past halfcentury. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices ofextremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism withCommunism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived asparanoids and conspiracy-mongers.The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editorof National view. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. e was a lifelong defender of JosephMcCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government wasset by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practicalconservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning toworry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, evenFascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National view had promoted."" In the next two decades,with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald agan completed a conservative revolution thatsueeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might beexpected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and theirfellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National view thought that the BirchSociety went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and theconservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that aused Welch of""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, themagazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative publicans, andhe consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in , 1962, Buckley urgedGoldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudiciousto attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the publican Presidential nomination in1964, and he winked at them in his aeptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is novice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democratssueeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. ( the Goldwater slogan ""In Your eart, You Know e'sRight,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know e's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he wasundeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixonamong a field of publican aspirants. e liked Ronald agan's politics, but considered agan, who had only recentlybeen elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the publican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.Nixon was a hard-nosed publican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he hadestablished himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger iss, a former officialat the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that weought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the publican NationalConvention. e served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken chargeof Nixon's media operations.But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some ofthe editors of National view, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whomWelch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidiousappeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took placelater that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservativeswere left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a publican congressman and a member of the John BirchSociety.Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. Theconservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon'ssecond term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifferencetoward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having readthe Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the publicanParty and in national politics.In 1976, Buckley and National view supported Ronald agan's primary challenge to Nixon's suessor, Gerald Ford.After two terms as governor, agan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: ashrewd leader as well as a man of principle. agan nearly sueeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion ofOrange County, and agan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. ispragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the publican nomination in 1980, when he chose therelatively moderate George . W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decisiondismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between publicanmoderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that agan was a reckless right-winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, whounderstood the political logic as clearly as agan had.As President, agan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's FreemenInstitute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-stylegovernment, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. eappointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chiefof staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policyadviser, Meese helped agan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker andBaker's deputy, the pragmatic aganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rightslegislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, aganskillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist publicans. And, when he recognized in MikhailGorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, agan pushedforward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner oward Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Sovietpropaganda.""Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, agan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of thefederal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War.  thestandpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other publican could come close tomatching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of agan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence ofextremism. George . W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscalcalamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series ofattacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, tocheck some of the wildest charges, the new publican ouse majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as mDeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment eventhough polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at firstto have a bit of agan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, forhis moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financialcollapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of aconservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National view, lamented that ""urbane visionaries andbuilders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears andresentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and isnow ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""Some publicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a formerspeechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about thepublicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In , thecongressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost avicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy.  his amazement, Inglis was confronted on thecampaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank hadbought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal serve and theBilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on FoxNews the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, ChristineO'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came fromSarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing publicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""ahuge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National publican Senatorial Committee would giveher its full backing.So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent publican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, asBuckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, thepublicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for agan.Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" day, Obama's Whiteouse is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and theleft, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may provetoo eentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred ofgovernment. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""amassive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the publican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bushpolitical operatives, including the former publican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietlysupplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, aording to arecent poll, more than seventy per cent of publicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that apublican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in thecoming midterm elections.In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the socialand political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It'son'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say thesame about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing adegree of power over Congress and the publican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. Fordefenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •ad more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz"
6649,6650,3619,0,7.0,703,3,1,3,"This is the distilled, pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment. Thefirst two paragraphs are the most important, completely aurate in assessment, the rest twaddle:1:1, Oct. 11,2010Why Obama Is Losing the Political WarBy Mark alperinBarack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise.  above, by elite opinion about his competence.  below, bymass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after's elections.With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the sameconclusions: the White ouse is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with orpersuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by FoxNews pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White ouse, Democraticand publican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised bigmoney for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama'stroubled first year, issue by issue.)On , after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —Obama said, ""Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of themiddle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challengeand are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception thatObama's decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and thateconomic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,immigration and spending.And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turnthings around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, butalso tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how someAmericans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,the publican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at aDayton career fair says starkly, ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, ""I've beenlooking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, thebreadlines for the Obama years.Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.e did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. e did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration tostave off a worldwide depression. is efforts at job creation have been obstructed by publicans (even the proposalsbased on policies supported by the GOP in the past). is opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offeredgenuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism withoutfurnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned theeconomy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize publicans and distract fromthe problems at hand. e has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in aclear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and theTroubled Asset lief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority tospur growth.Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it somethingabout an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the timeof a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and histop advisers wading into allegations that publicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money launderedthrough the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negativetelevision commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters careabout, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat storyline). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for abetter economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said, ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,"" and that's still notourring for too many Americans.The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in. publicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning thepage on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, publicans are almost certainly goingto demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the ObamaAdministration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.• Find this article at:• http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.htmlCopyright © 2010 Time Inc.

6654,6655,2255,0,7.0,634,3,1,3,"The uffington Post 12, 2010oward FinemanfinemanAhuffingtonpost.com I uffPost portingThe Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility OfObamaFirst Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PMLOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know whyPaul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far morepotent and popular foe than President Barack Obama.On my first day working for The uffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago atthe Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stageinterview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna uffington. It was a tricky mix of professionalincest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once againout in the state.I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed:Like Voldemort's, Obama's is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats.At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president madea stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without oncementioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches ofgovernment. be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch publicanterritory. ""We're farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever,"" GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told meyesterday. ""President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak.""Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensivepredicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you'rea Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic suessor.Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the ausation that he didn't try to help. Buthis travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center ofattention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to thepoint, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. Theywere glad to have him.Rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton wastreated with a respect bordering on awe. is familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, givinghim an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age.Clinton is beloved In Kentucky. e won the state twice. e speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes ofworking-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky --Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularlygood in the context of what has followed.These days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressedby former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 --talked of the former president in messianic terms. ""Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!"" he shouted. The crowd of 2,000,most of them students, didn't laugh. They seemed to think he was right.ow any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they'd be joiningthe same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads.But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it's done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton's gift was his abilityto untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of thepowerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. publicans and their corporate allies were outto shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that theythemselves destroyed. ""I gave you budget surpluses!"" Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence.Knowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to payback their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. Paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, giventhe GOP's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think Clinton is right.Which is why Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means that he did what he came to do.Which means Obama will remain invisible, at least in Kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come.Ci"

6687,6688,3675,0,4.0,706,3,1,3,"I know I'm not supposed to lift my head from the QDDR, but just thought you would like to see this — it's for all the ideasyou wanted promoted when you picked me. AMThe Crossroads NationBy DAVID BROOKSBill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ""new foundation."" ButClinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about whatedifice is going to go on top of that foundation.They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite definedAmerica's coming economic identity.In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economicactivity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation andcreativity are the engines of economic growth.oward Gardner of arvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little placesomewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. Shemoves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to createsomething amazing.Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in hergroup. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined andimproved.The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talentedpeople get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya orsome other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things youare thinking about, creating the things you want to create.If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionateabout many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities leadthe world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. ugeventure capital funds already exist.Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation ofimmigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests thatAmerica is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles ofkinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority. this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. Thecrucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can makeitself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in whichshe laid out the logic of this new situation: ""In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasinglydense global web.""Slaughter's essay was titled ""America's Edge."" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the rightkinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite ofpassage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that."

But is it really strong authority that he wishes?In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-Semite and JewI am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the BarackObama era. It might have been in  2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heardurgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people thatare purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outsidea show in no. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.In  2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book public Gomorrah(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside JonathanWalton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gayformer Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozencollege publicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hystericalyoung man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as heshouted threats.Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? is name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operativeof a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens ofpublican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest inhomosexuals. is intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay oax, arguing that homosexuality is at once acurable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history ofrun-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to besymptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days ofrage were only beginning.The constellationThrough his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. e campaigned againstpartisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it wasmerely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority andwomen's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed tothink that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald agan and the right and their strategies of polarisation wasnot deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gesturestoward bipartisanship. is view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs butseparated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified hisinnocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffectedconservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal agan who can reunite America"". This optimismpervaded the White ouse as the new president and his aides sought out publicans willing to vote for his programmes.After all, why couldn't we all just get along?In his autobiographical book The Audacity of ope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serveas a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the mostfearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23  2009).Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejectedObama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that soughtto challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eentric, was Orly Taitz, adentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settlingin the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily thatObama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and itler's Germany.""After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in awaii,Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in  2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowendemanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, anOrange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publiclyprayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily aented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewersfrom Sean annity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired asan indirect result of his hosting of her).In  2009, the Texas presentative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidentialcandidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voicein government and made an indelible impact on the publican grassroots. By  2009, 28% of publicanrespondents to a Kos/search 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren'tsure"". ""Obama should be in the Big ouse"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White ouse!""When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movementactivated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making himseem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver ahealthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream ofbipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12  2009, tens of thousands of far-right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged onWashington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News'stop-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siegementality) that Americans experienced on 11  2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from itler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he hadfashioned depicting Obama and ouse of presentatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. Aording toanother activist, Obama's agenda was similar to itler's: ""itler took over the banking industry, did he not? And itler hadhis own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during ralliesagainst Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and asthe French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealotassassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama toitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging governmentof the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helpedObama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had nointerest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The TeaParty's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the presidentand his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was alwaystransparent.The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democratsbut also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convincedthis would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reportingthat 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximatefigure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedomworks!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the TeaParty movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close publican ties.The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the TeaParty ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey'slobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giantBristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance fromSaddam ussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collecteda consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorkspaid out much of its money to an assortment of publican political consultants.The rumourIf Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days afterObama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quittingbecame clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regularcontributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidentialcampaign and a travelling carnival.Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within thepublican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by publican politicosdesperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain'scampaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be""catastrophic"" for the GOP. is doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in  2009 revealing her as oneof the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately forSchmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the publican Party, itsmost fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.A special congressional election in New York's heavily publican 23rd district in  2009 was the first major testof Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug offman, an unknownfar-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderatepublican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to animprobable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her alliesclaimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure publicans from the party. Shewent on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian presentative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky'sGOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand'sregular publican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gaymarriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herselfaordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcarereform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to takeadvantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blastedout on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that wouldrecommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palintransformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor BetsyMcCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimedin an article published in the New public that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy intothe government's programme (the article, widely circulated by publicans, would go on to win a National MagazineAward, only to be retracted years later by the New public's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing arumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey'slatest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into themainstream.In  2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of ealth'schief bioethicist and brother of White ouse chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, ausing him of seeking to reintroduce itler'sT-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatusreviving the euthanasia of itler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkincharged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with aitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic presentative, aLaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-itler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazipolicy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former ouse speakerNewt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences ofindignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of deathpanels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, aused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price oneach individual."" e thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the publicanParty. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of thefederal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of thegovernment to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.The enemyThe slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, KeepAmerica Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movementthat was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see peopleso concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems soreluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the sametable, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon ofSkidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and m Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) havedemonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explainthe effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly Americanand somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tacticalreasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent votersresponded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standingarmy ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committedby far-right extremists. In  2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swatteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently overfears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi websiteportraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thoroughinvestigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another oasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Partyrallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operationscue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game bythe anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eightepisodes of Bill O'illy's ""O'illy Factor,"" O'illy had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'illy proclaimed.In  2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh andgunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in hisonline diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronicmasturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexualfrustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! e will be suessful. The liberal mediaLOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for theeconomy and such. ere it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitudething. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddysays! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the publicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodinirevealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National view ad.A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bringthe country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders willachieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologicallydeath-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Deathlives!""The bibleMore than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation andconspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the whiteculture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White ouse green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former communityorganiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade.  there, Beck targeted anotherblack Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence ofObama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough toBeck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that ""Obama's SS"" was beingtrained across inner-city America.In  2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended touse the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (is statement was reminiscent ofRush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and annahGiles inside Acorn field offices.In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed shewas a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimpcostume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles lateradmitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated ofall criminal wrongdoing.In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative palsdisguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator MaryLandrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-fundedconservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurturedleading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph ed, and Jeff Gannon.While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for suess. is show earnedthe highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'illy and Sean annity. In the process, Beck'sopinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything weknow"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""e's opened our eyes to so much.""But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's publican counter-revolution of 1994,Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash inhopes of becoming the next oward Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaineand alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, thedrugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, whocalled himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked awayin a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape fromfreedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs intoconservative radio diatribes.,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's eadline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent politicalworldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained andoften snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,Matthew iltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promotingthe work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on thewebsite of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became theidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazonand a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 toselling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It islittle more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separationis un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. BenjaminFranklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes andfathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points withfringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. Aording to Skousen, Dodd claimed that""powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the UnitedStates into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which hefounded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. eboasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar oover and said he provided him with research on communistplots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumoursof oover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,""conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government."" there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, andearning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which aused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-communism for obvious financial purposes.""Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President DwightEisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his d-bashing lecture tours. e went off theradar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to ause the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrollingeveryone from o Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saintsdistanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. is work fell through the margins and might have disappearedentirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchikobserved in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the TeaParty ""suggests that the modern base of the publican Party is headed to a very strange place.""The descentBesides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassrootscelebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in  at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence hismentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged hisspellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply"", Mack warned, ""you control thepeople. And that's the first step to slavery.""Already a hero to conservatives for suessfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady andgunViolence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mackreemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled TeaParty militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore torefuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-establishedfigure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy andTactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals, secret policemen, rats."" With Obama in office,Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts bycashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed thegreatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. presentative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reformwas introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him thede facto swing vote on the ouse version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensurethat the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. eintroduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insuranceplans. The amendment, which passed the ouse but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point inhealthcare negotiations. ""e's a big hero now in the pro-life community"", Deal udson - former Catholic issues adviser toGeorge W Bush - told me in  2009. ""Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democratshaving any power."" the chagrin of the publicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. Aording toudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provisionforbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in  2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now heand his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reportsseeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like dState.org churned outvirulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens ofdiatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""On 20  2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation ofObama's pep talk to the ouse Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic presentative John Lewis, a hero of thecivil-rights movement, and presentative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through thecrowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot"", elicitinglaughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, presentative EmanuelCleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly standwith any of you men here and take these fascists down"", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front ofan amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""The next day, publican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. Thedemonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the ousefloor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.publican presentative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demandeda motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. Inresponse, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the publicans. ""The motion to commit doesnot support life"", Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" eckling from the publican sideinterrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the ouse chamber, presentative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wingpublican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, ""Babykiller!"" Other publicans joined in, parroting base insults.While the publicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for aright-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows"",Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them andrun to break again."" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas andArizona had been shattered.Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxedto the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. presentativeAnthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.The brother of presentative m Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotagedafter a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouragedactivists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democraticpresentative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through thewindow of presentative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniperattacks.After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windowsof elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violencethickening, Palin took to her Twitter aount to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't treat, Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded thefirst phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship."

The Burmese regime has repeatedlyrejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she maytravel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. Theyshould also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma's 2,100 political prisoners.We urge Burma's leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyiand other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, anddemocratic future.###"

Such a mood now seems to bespreading through the United States. It'snot so surprising, really: Since the attacksof  11, 2001, fear hasbeen iniiecttcl into this ""homeland"" like adrug and a penumbia of official secrecy hassettled over the land in a way that makesthe secrecy of the Cold War years (whenthis country faced a superpower, not aragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, andterrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.In an atmosphere of swirling fears andhysteria amid declining living conditions,""explanations"" that at other times mighthave remained confined to tiny crews ofconspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain apatina of plausibility and so traction. Nowonder then that, as hard times hit, as thefinancial system seemed on the verge ofcollapse, as unemployment soared and amassive wave of home foreclosures sweptinto view, increasing numbers ofAmericans became prey to any wackyexplanation for our troubles, none more sothan the idea that Islam was somehowresponsible, that mosques and Islamiccenters meant for a sliver of a minority herewere capable of imposing anything, no lessa way of life on this country, or that Sharialaw (of all things) might somehow wormits way into state teal systems, or thatYouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthyof suppression, or... well, you name it.Max Blumenthal, author of the bestsellingbook ptblican Gomorrah: Inside theMovement Thai Shattered the Party, hasdone the necessary legwork to""take us deepinto one of those crews of conspiracy-mongers who, at another time, just aboutno one would have paid much attention to,but in twenty-first-century America havegained a remarkable audience. They are achilling barometer of the changing weatherin America. rnThe GreatIslamophobicCrusadeInside the BizarreCabal of SecretiveDonors, DemagogicBloggers, Pseudo-Scholars, EuropeanNeo-Fascists, ViolentIsraeli Settlers, andpublican Presidentialopefuls Behind theCrusadeBy Max BlumenthalNine years after 9/11,hysteria about Muslims inAmerican life has grippedthe country. With it hasGone an outburst of arsonattacks on mosques,campaigns to stop theirconstruction, and thebranding of the Muslim-American community,overwhelmingly moderate,as a hotbed of potentialterrorist recruits. The frenzyhas raged from ruralTennessee to New YorkCity, while in Oklahoma,voters even overwhelminglyApproved a ballot measurebanning the implementationof Sharia law in Americancourts (not that such aprospect existed). Thiscampaign of islamophobiawounded President Oba.mapolitically, as one out of fiveAmericans have boughtinto a sustained chorus offalse rumors about his secretMuslim faith. And it mayhave tainted views ofMuslims in general; an 2010 Pew searchCenter poll revealed that,among Americans, thefavorability rating ofMuslims had dropped by 11points since 2005.Erupting so many years afterthe  11th trauma,this spasm of anti-Muslimbigotry might seem oddlytimed and unexpectedlyspontaneous. But thinkagain: it's the fruit of anorganized, long-termcampaign by a tightconfederation of right-Wingactivists and operatives whofirst focused onIsia.mophobia soon after the 11th attacks, butonly attained critical massduring the Obama era. Itwas then that embitteredconservative forces, votedout of power in 2008, soughtwith remarkable suess toleverage cultural resentmentinto political and partisangain.This network is obsessivelyfixated on the supposedspread of Muslim influencein America. Its apparatusspans continents, extendingfrom Tea Party activists hereto the European far right. Itbrings together in commoncause right-wing ultra-Zionists, Christianevangelicals, and racistBritish soer hooligans. Itreflects an aggressively pro-Israel sensibility, with itskey figures venerating theJewish state as a MiddleEastern Fort Apache on thefront lines of the GlobalWar on Terror and urgingthe U.S. and variousEuropean powers to emulateits heavy-handed methods.Little of recent AmericanJslamophobia (with a.strongemphasis on the ""phobia"") issheer happenstance. Yearsbefore Tea Party shocktroops massed for angryprotests outside theproposed site of an Islamiccommunity center in lowerManhattan, representativesof the Israel lobby and theJewish-Americanestablishment launched acampaign against pro-Palestinian campus activismthat would prove a seedbedfor everything to come. Thatcampaign quickly -- andperhaps predictably --morphed into a series ofcrusades against mosquesand islarilic schools which,in turn, attracted anassortment of shady butexceptionally energeticmilitants into the network'sranks.Besides providing the initialenergy for the islamophobiccrusade, conservativeelements from within thepro-Israel lobby bankrolledthe network's apparatus,enabling it to influence thenational debate. Onephilanthropist in particularhas provided thebeneficence to propel thecampaign ahead. e is alittle-known Los Angeles-area software securityentrepreneur named AubreyChernick, who operates outof a security consulting firmblandly named the NationalCenter for Crisis andContinuity Coordination. Aformer trustee of theWashington Institute forNear East Policy, which hasserved as a think tank for theAmerican Israeli PublicAffairs Committee(AIPAC), a frontlinelobbying group for Israel,Chernick is said to be worth$750 million.Chemick's fortune is punycompared to that of thebillionaire Koch Brothers,extraction industry titanswho fund Tea Party-relatedgroups like Americans forProsperity, and it is dwarfedby the financial empire ofaim Saban, the Israeli-American media baron whois one of the largest.-orivatedonors to the Democraticparty and recently matched$9 million raised for theFriends of the IsraeliDefense Forces in a singlenight. owever, by injectinghis money into a small butinfluential constellation ofgroups and individuals witha narrow agenda. Chernickhas had a considerableimpact.Through the FairtmookFoundation, a private entityhe and his wife Joycecontrol, Chernick hasprovided funding to groupsranging from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)and CAMERA, a right-wing, pro-Israel, media-watchdog outfit, to violentIsraeli settlers living onPalestinian lands and figureslike the pseudo-academicauthor Robert Spencer, whois largely responsible forpopularizing conspiracytheories about the comingconquest of the West byMuslim fanatics seeking toestablish a worldwidecaliphate. gether, thesegroups spread hysteria aboutMuslims into MiddleAmerican communitieswhere immigrants from theMiddle East have recentlysettled, and they watchedwith glee as likelypublican presidentialfrontrunners from Mikeuckabee to Sarah Palinpmmoted their cause andoarpe.ki their tropes.Perhaps the only thing moresurprising than theincreasingly widespreadappeal of islamophobia isthat, just a few years ago,the phenomenon wasconfined to a few collegecampuses and an inner cityneighborhood, and that itseemed like a fleeting fadthat would soon pass fromthe American politicallandscape.Birth of a NetworkThe fslamophobic crusadewas launched in earnest atthe peak of George W.Bush's prestige when theneoconservatives and theirallies were riding high. In2003, three years after thecollapse of President BillClinton's attempt to resolvethe Israeli-Palestinian issueand in the immediate wakeof the invasion of Iraq, anetwork of Jewish groups,ranging from ADL and the.American JewishCommittee to AIPAC,gathered to address whatthey saw as a sudden rise inpro-Palestinian activism oncollege campusesnationwide. That meetinggave birth to the DavidProject, a campus advocacygroup led by Charles Peters,who had co-foundedCAMERA, one of the manyoutfits bankrolled byChernick. With the help ofpublic relationsprofessionals,. Petersci a plan to ""takeback the campus byinfluencing public opinionthrough lectures. theInternet, and coalitions,"" asa memo produced at thetime by the consulting firmMcKinsey and Companystated.In 2004, after conferringwith Martin Kramer, afellow at the WashingtonInstitute for Near EastPolicy, the pro-Israel thinktank Where Chernoff hadserved as a trustee, Petersproduced a documentaryfilm that he called Columbia""rbecornint., It was -filledwith claims from Jewishstudents at ColumbiaUniversity claiming theyhad endured intimidationand insults from Arabprofessors. The filmportrayed that New YorkCity school's Department ofMiddle East and AsianLanguages and Cultures as ahothouse of anti-Semitism.In their complaints, thestudents focused on onefigure in particular: Joseph.vlassa.d, a Palestinianprofessor of Middle Eaststudies. e was known forhis passionate advocacy ofthe formation of a binationalstate between Israel andPalestine, as well as for hisstrident criticism of what hetermed ""the racist characterof Israel."" The filmidentified him as ""one of themost dangerous intellectualson campus,"" while he wasfeatured as a crucial villainin The Professors: The 101Most Dangerous Academicsin America, a book by the(Chemick-•funded)neoconservative activistDavid orowitz. AsMassad was seeking tenureat the time, he wasespecially vulnerable to thissort of wholesale assault.When the controversy overMassad's views intensified,Congressman AnthonyWeiner, a liberal New YorkDemocrat who pqee:lescri himself as arepresentative of ""the ZOA[Zionist Organization ofAmerica] wing of theDemocratic Party,""demanded that ColumbiaPresident Lee Bollinger,arenowned First Amendmentscholar, fire the professor.Bollinger responded byissuing uncharacteristicallydefensive statements aboutthe ""limited"" nature ofacademic freedom.In the end, however, none ofthe charges stuck. Indeed,the testimonies in the DavidProject film were eventuallyeither discredited or nevercorroborated. In 2009,Massad earned tenure afterwinning Columbia'sprestigious Lionel TrillingAward for excellence inscholarship.aving demonstrated itsability to intimidate facultymembers and even powerfuluniversity administrators,however, Kramer claimed amoral victory in the name ofhis project, boasting to thepress that ""this is a turningpoint."" While the DavidProject subsequentlyfostered chapters oncampuses nationwide, itsdirector set out on adifferent path -- initially,into the streets of Boston in2004 to oppose theconstruction of the IslamicSociety of Boston CulturalCenter.For nearly 15 years, theIslamic Society of Bostonhad sought to build thecenter in the heart ofRoxbury, the city's largestblack neighborhood, toserve its sizable Muslimpopulation. Withendorsements from orThomas Menino and leadingMassachusetts lawmakers,the mosque's constructionseemed like a fait aompli -- until, that is, the RupertMurdoch-owned Bostonerald and his local FoxNews affiliate snapped intoaction. Boston Globecolumnist Jeff Jacoby alsochimed in with a series ofreports claiming the center'splans were evidence of aSaudi Arabian plot to bolsterthe influence of radicalIslam in the United States,and possibly even to trainunderground terror cells.It was at this point that theDavid Project entered thefray, convening elements ofthe local pro-Israelcommunity in the Bostonarea to seek strategies totorpedo the project.Aording to emqiisobtained by the IslamicSociety's lawyers in alawsuit against the DavidProject, the organizerssettled on a campaign ofyears of nuisance lawsuits,along with ausations thatthe center had receivedforeign finding from ""theWahhabi movement inSaudi Arabia or... theMoslem Brotherhood.""In response, a grassrootscoalition of liberal Jewsinitiat4d inter-faith effortsaimed at ending acontroversy that hadessentially beenmanufactured out of thin airand was corroding relationsbetween the Jewish andMuslim communities in thecity. Peters would not,however, relent. 'We aremore concerned now thanwe have ever been about aSaudi influence of localmosques,"" he ,apounced ata suburban Bostonsynagogue in 2007.After paying out millions ofdollars in legal bills andenduring countless smears,the Islamic Society ofBoston completed theconstruction of itscommunity center in 2008.Meanwhile, not surprisingly,nothing came of the DavidProject's dark warnings. AsBoston-area National PublicRadio reporter Philip Martinreflected in  2010,""The horror stories thatpreceded [the center's]development seem shrill andhistrionic in retrospect.""The Network ExpandsThis second failed campaignwas, in the end, more aboutmovement building thansuess, no less nationalsecurity. The local crusadeestablished an effectiveblueprint for generatinghysteria against theestablishment of Islamiccenters and mosques acrossthe country, whilegalvanizing a cast ofcharacters who would forman anti-Muslim networkwhich would gain attentionand suess in the years tocome.In 2007, these figurescoalesced into a proto-movement that launched anew crusade, this timetargeting. the Khalil GibranInternational Academy, asecular Arabic-Englishelementary school inBrooklyn, New York.Calling their ad hoc pressuregroup, Stop the Madrassahmadrassah being simplythe Arab word for ""school"" -- the coalition's activistsincluded an array ofpreviously unknown zealotswho made no attempt todisguise their extreme viewswhen it came to Islam as areligion, as well as Muslimsin America. Their statedgoal was to challenge theschool's establishment onthe basis of its violation ofthe church-state separationin the U.S.Constitution. The true aimof the coalition, however,was transparent: to pressurethe city's leadership to adoptan antagonistic posturetowards the local Muslimcommunity.The activists zeroed in onthe school's principal,Debbie Almontaser, aveteran educator of Yemenidescent, and baselessly.branded her ""a jihadist"" aswell as a 9/11 denier. Theyalso aused her of-- asPamela Geller, a far-rightblogger just then gainingprominence put it,""whitewash[ing] thegenocide against theJews."" Daniel Pipes, aneoconservative academicpreviously active in thecampaigns against JosephMassad and the BostonIslamic center (and whosepro-Likud think tank,Middle East .Forum, hasreceived $150,000 fromChernick) Jamed theschool should not go aheadbecause ""Arabic-languageinstruction is inevitablyladen with Pan-Arabist andIslamist baggage."" As thecampaign reached a feverpitch, Almontaser reportedthat members of thecoalition were actuallystallsinQ her wherever shewent.Given what ColumbiaJournalism School professorand former New York Timesreporter Samuel Freedmancalled ""her clear, publicrecord of interfaith activismand outreach,"" includingwork with the New YorkPolice Department and theAnti-Defamation Leagueafter the  11thattacks, the assault on.Almontaser seemed littleshort of bizarre -- until herassailants discovered aphotograph of a T-shirtproduced by AWAAM, alocal Arab feministorganization, that read""Intifada NYC."" As itturned out, AWAAMsometimes shared officespace with a Yemeni-American association onwhich Almontaser served asa board member. Thoughthe connection seemed like astretch, it promoted the lineof attack the Stop theMadrassah coalition hadbeen seeking.aving found a way towedge the emotional issueof the Israel-Palestineconflict into a. previouslyNew York-centeredcampaign, the school'sopponents next gained aplatform at the Murdoch-owned New York Post,where reporters ChuckBennett and Jana Winterclaimed her T-shirt was""apparently a call for aGaza-style uprising in theBig Apple."" WhileAlmontaser attempted toexplain to the Post'sreporters that she rejectedterrorism„ the Anti-Defamation League chimed.in on cue. ADL spokesmanOren Segal told the Post:""The T-shirt is a reflectionof a movement thatincreasingly lauds violenceagainst Israelis instead ofrejecting it. That isdisturbing.""Before any Qassam rocketscould be launched fromAlmontaser's school, herformer ally New Yorkor Michael Bloombergcaved to the growingpressure and threatened toshut down the school,prompting her to resign. AJewish principal who spokeno Arabic replacedAlmontaser, who later fileda lawsuit against the city forbreaching her free speechrights. In 2010, the EqualEmployment OpportunityCommission ui that NewYork's Department ofEducation had ""suumbedto the very bias that thecreation of the school wasintended to dispel"" by firingAlmontaser and urged it payher $300,000 in damages.The commission alsoconcluded that the Post hadquoted her misleadingly.Though it failed to stop theestablishment of the KhalilGibran Academy,•theburg:eoning anti-M sliinmovement sueeded inforcing city leaders to bendto its will, and havinglearned just how to do that,then moved on in search ofmore high-profile targets.As the ,New York Timess!..t_..at the time, ""Thefight against the school...was only an early skirmishin a broader, nationalstruggle.""s a battle that has reallyjust begun."" Pipes told theTimes. Scam to PublicityCoupPipes couldn't have beenmore on the mark. In late2009, the Isiamophobessprang into action againwhen the Cordoba Initiative,a non-profit Muslim groupheaded by Feisai AbdulRauf, an exceedinglymoderate Sufi Muslim imamwho regularlylepic,,etiting theUnited States at the behestof the State Department,announced that it was goingto build a community centerin downtown New ""NCorkCity. With the help ofinvestors, Raufs CordobaInitiative purchased spacetwo blocks from GroundZero in Manhattan. Thespace was to contain aprayer area as part of a largecommunity center thatwould be open to everyonein the neighborhood.None of these facts matteredto Pamela Geller. Thanks toconstant prodding at herNog, Atlas Shrugged. Gellermade Cordoba'sconstruction plans a nationalissue, provokino ferventcalls faml conservatives toprotect the ""hallowedground"" of 9/11 fromcreeping Sharia. (That the""mosque"" would have beenout of sight of Ground Zeroand that the neighborhoodwas, in fact.everything from strip clubsto fast-food joints didn'tmatter.) Geller's activismagainst Cordoba ouseearned the 52-year-old full-time blogger the attentionshe apparently craved.,including a • 1 inthe Neu, York ThIleS andfrequent cable news spots,esoeciallv, of course, on FoxNews.Mainstream reporters tendedto focus on Geller's bizarrestunts. She posted a videoof herselfin a string bikini on a FortLauderdale beach, forinstance, while ranting about""left-tards"" and ""Naziezbollah."" er gall forboycotting Campbell's Soupbecause the companyoffered halal -- approvedunder Islamic law (as kosherfood is under Jewish law) --versions of its products gother much attention, as didher .cron-lotior of a screedclaiming that PresidentBarack Obama was theillegitimate lovechild ofMalcolm X.Geller had never earned aliving as a journalist. Shesupported herself withmillions of dollars in adivorce settlement and lifeinsurance money from herex-husband. e died in2008, a year after beingfor an alleged $1.3million scam he wasaused of-running out of acar dealership he co-ownedwith Geller. Independentlywealthy and with time onher hands, Geller provedable indeed when it came toexploiting her strange mediastardom to in.cite the alreadyorganized political networkof islamophobes to intensifytheir crusade.She also benefited fromclose alliances with leadingislamophobes from Europe.Among Ocher's allies wasAndrew Gravers, a Danishactivist who formed thegroup Stop theIslamicization of Europe,and :.1a.-ye it the unusuallyblunt motto: ""Racism is thelowest form of humanstupidity, but Islamophobiais the height of commonsense."" Gravers' groupinspired Geller's own U.S.-based outfit, Stop theIslamicization of America,which she formed with herfriend Robert Spencer, apseudo-scholar whosebestselling books, includingThe Truth AboutMuhammad, Founder of theWorld's Most Intolerantligion, prompted formeradvisor to President RichardNixon and Muslim activistRobert Crane to ca/1""the principal leader... inthe new academic .field ofMuslim bashing.""(Aording to the websitealmost $1 millionin donations from Chernickhas been steered toSpencer's Jihad Watchgroup through Davidorowitz's FreedomCenter.)Perfect sources forpublican political figuresin search of the next hot-button cause, their rhetoricfound its way into thetalking points of NewtGingrich and Sarah Patin asthey propelled the crusadeagainst Cordoba ouse intothe national spotlight.Gingrich soon pared thecommunity center to a Nazisign next to the olocaustMemorial Museum, whilePatin called it ""a stab in theheart"" of ""the eartland.""Meanwhile, Tea Partycandidates like publicanIlario Pantano, an Iraq warveteran who killed twounarmed Iraqi civilians,shooting them 60 times -- heeven stopped to reloadmade their opppsition toCordoba ouse thecenterpiece of midtermcongressional campaignsconducted hundreds of milesfrom Ground Zero.Geller's campaign against""the mosque at GroundZero"" gained an unexpectedassist and a veneer oflegitimacy from establishedJewish leaders like Anti-Defamation LeagueNational Director AbrahamFoxman. ""Survivors of theolocaust are entitled tofeelings that are irrational,""he et.:narked to the NewYork Times. Comparing thebereaved family members of9-1 1 victims to olocaustsurvivors, Foxman insisted,""Their anguish entitles themto positions that otherswould categorize asirrational or bigoted.""Soon enough, David arris,director of the (Chernick-funded) American JewishCommittee, was demandingthat Cordoba's leaders becompelled to reveal their""true attitudes"" aboutPalestinian militant groupsbefore construction on thecenter was initiated. RabbiMarvin ier of the SimonWiesenthal Center of LosAngeles, another majorJewish group, insisted itwould be ""insensitive"" forCordoba to build near ""acemetery,"" though hisorganization had recentlybeen granted permissionfrom the municipality ofJerusalem to build a""museum of tolerance"" to becalled The Center foruman Dignity directly ontop of the MamillaCemetery, a MuslimGraveyard that containedthousands of grave sitesdating back 1,200 years.Inspiration from IsraelIt was evident from theinvolvement of figures likeGravers that theIslamophobic network in theUnited States represented atrans-Atlantic expansion ofsimmering resentment inEurope. There, the far-rightwas storming to victories inparliamentary electionsacross the continent in partby appealing to thesimmering anti-Muslimsentiments of voters in ruraland working-classcommunities. The extent ofthe collaboration betweenEuropean and AmericanIslamophobes has onlycontinued to grow withGeller, Spencer, and evenGingrich standing besideEurope's most prominentanti-Muslim figure, Dutchpad iamentarian GeedWilders, at a rally againstCordoba ouse. In themeantime. Geller wasissuing statements ofsunport for the EmdishDefense League, a band ofuoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazisand former members of thewhites-only British NationalParty who intimidateMuslims in the streets ofcities like Birmingham andLondon.In addition, the trans-Atlantic Islamophobiccrusade has stretched intoIsrael, a country that hascome to symbolize thenetwork's fight against theMuslim menace. As Gellertold the New York Times'Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a verygood guide because, like Isaid, in the war between thecivilized man and thesavage, you side with thecivilized man.""EDL members regularlywave Israeli flags at theirrallies, while Wilders claimsto have formed his viewsabout Muslims during thetime he worked on an Israelicooperative farm in the1980s. e has, he says,visited the country morethan 40 times since to meetwith rightist political allieslike Aryeh Eldad, a memberof the Israeli Knesset andleader of the far rightatikvah faction of theNational Union Party. ehas called for forcibly""transferring"" thePalestinians living in Israeland the oupied West Bankto Jordan and Egypt. On 5th, for example,Wilders traveled to Israel fora 'ffrjend nieei,imr, withForeign Minister Avi2clorLieberman, then declared ata press conference thatIsrael should annex the WestBank and set up aPalestinian state in Jordan.In the apocalyptic clash ofcivilizations the global anti-Muslim network has soughtto incite, tiny armed Jewishsettlements like Yitzar,located on the hills abovethe oupied Palestinian cityof Nablus, represent front-line fortresses. InsideYitzar's state-fundedyeshiva, a rabbi namedYitzhak Shapira hasinstructed students in whatrules must be applied whenconsidering killing non-Jews. Shapira summarizedhis opinions in a widelypublicized book. rataMelech, or The King'srah. Claiming that non-Jews are ""uncompassionateby nature,"" Shapira citedrabbinical texts to declarethat gentiles could be killedin order to ""curb their evilinclinations."" ""There isjustification,"" the rabbiproclaimed, ""for killingbabies if it is clear that theywill grow up to harm us, and,in such a situation they' maybe harmed deliberately, andnot only during combat withadults.""In 2006, the rabbi wasbriefly held by Israeli policefor urging his supporters tomurder all Palestinians overthe age of 13. Two yearslater, aording to the Israelinewspaper Ilaaretz, hea rabbinical letter insupport of Israeli Jews whohad brutally assaulted twoArab youths on the country'solocaust membranceDay. That same year,Shapira was arrested as asuspect in helpinga rocket attackagainst a Palestinian villagenear Nablus.Though he was not charged,his name came up again inconnection with another actof terror when, in 2010, the Israeli policeraided his settlementseeking vandals who had setfire to a nearby mosque.One of Shapira's followers,an American immigrant,Jack _Mite"", has confessed tomurdering two innocentPalestinians and attemptingto the kill the liberal Israelihistorian Ze'ev Sternhellwith a mail bomb.What does all this have todo with Islamophobiccampaigns in the UnitedStates? A great deal,actually. Through NewYork-based tax-exempt non-profits like the Central Fundof Israel and AteretCohenim, for instance, theomnipresent AubreyChernick has sent tens ofthousands of dollars tosupport the Yitzarsettlement, as well as to themessianic settlers dedicatedto ""Judaizing"" EastJerusalem. The settlementmovement's leading onlinenews magazine. ArutzSheva, has feattired Gelleras a columnist. A friend ofGeller's, Beth Gili.nsky, aright-wing activist with agroup called the Coalition toonor Ground Zero and thefounder of the JewishAction Alliance (apparentlyttun. out of a Manhattan realestate office), organized alarge rally in New York Cityin  2010 to protest theObama administration's callfor a settlement freeze.Among Chemick's majorfunding recipients is asupposedly ""apolitical""group called Aish. atorahthat claims to educate Jewsabout their heritage.

7083,7084,3814,0,113.0,723,3,1,3,"Keith Richards as Memories to BurnBy JANET MASLINIt is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary ifevery wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards hasa 3 o'clock appointment. ""Come on in, he'll be here in a minute,"" an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd's piethat Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stonesdon't play until another shepherd's pie shows up.Chalk up the promptness to the man's new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is farfrom the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very muchabout himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote ""Ronnie,"" in which he described Brian Jones as ""me in a blond wig."" BillWyman, the band's retired bass player and bean counter, wrote ""Stone Alone,"" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc wentunmentioned. r. Richards has written the keeper: ""Life,"" a big, fierce, game-changing aount of the Stones' nearlyhalf-century-long adventure.""It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,"" he says about the book. ""I'd rather make ro records.""But he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. day, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he ispositively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk ofsteaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:both a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.""I've been through that phase,"" he says. ""Don't know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.""e's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in ""Life"": the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; thelovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted olderone; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shockover the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All ofthis is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is ahand-written note on its jacket flap: ""Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it.""ow, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as ""Satisfaction?"" ""I think my mainconcern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,"" he says. ""Fox had to do a little sleuthing."" Fox isJames Fox, the journalist and author of ""White Mischief,"" who has been Mr. Richards's friend over many years and washis collaborator in putting ""Life"" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7million.)Mr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawingupon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. ""Spent day practising,"" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. ""Worthwhile, I hope!"" Also exhumed: a 1962 letterfrom Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. e signs off""Luff/Keith XXXXX""These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading tasteruns to naval history and the novels of Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In anycase they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and ""Life"" began to click. Once his stories were toldand a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox readB6the whole book aloud. ""What I couldn't guess was that he'd be such a very good natural editor,"" Mr. Fox, reached by e-mail, says of Mr. Richards. ""e cut, aordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.""As for calling the book ""Life,"" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. ""My Life"" was what the book was to be called. ""Isaid 'I tell you what, just cut off the 'My,' and you've got a title,"" he says. e might just as appropriately have used anothertitle he likes, ""Keep It Dark."" But, he says, ""I'm saving it for a song.""The contents of ""Life"" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who waspersuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having apicture taken with him. ow did Mr. Richards get so lucky? ""I really can't explain it,"" he says, deadpan, about that now.""be I've got an honest face.""It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims tohave done suessfully 30 years ago. ""Stories like this aren't told very much,"" he insists. ""There aren't many people willingto tell them.""Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. ""My most spectacular one was inSacramento. ..."" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching anungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. e has a good laugh at the memory of findinghimself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""""Life"" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a bookthat pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. ""Cold-blooded"" and ""vicious"" are only two of themore printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an ""old gasbag."" Mick Taylor, the formerRolling Stone, ""didn't do anything"" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (""Performance,"" starringMr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quicklyenough to suit Mr. Richards. (e shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.Richards remembers replying with this: ""Later, pal.""As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested youngJagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger'scontributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like ""Disco Boy.""In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: ""It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'mtrying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,"" he says. And sure: ""There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh itall out, those things count for nothing."" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead oftime. ""The important thing to me,"" he says, ""was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.""Andis there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? ""No.""But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As ""Life"" emphatically demonstrates, the answer isyes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls ""Keefs GuitarWorkshop."" ere are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment onwhich they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for""Street Fighting Man,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and part of ""Gimme Shelter."" ere's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's""eartbreak otel"" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that ""eartbreakotel"" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he issurprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them todo so. What he finds most gratifying about having written ""Life"" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp thebreadth and range of this book's material. e is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, ""that what I hopedwas worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.""It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle ofthe wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the itemslikeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, morecigarettes in a pack.""Do you mind if I smoke?"" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certainlegal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn't touched thecigarettes. e hasn't even looked at them. e has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurrywhite thing he's smoking.""That?"" he says innocently when asked about the picture. ""Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing."""
7084,7085,3815,0,7.0,693,3,1,3,"aned by Woodward's Fireby Leslie . Gelb 23, 2010 I 1:32pmThe president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie . Gelb on thefallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.Lots of White ouse officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of istory, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind theclosed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men werehelping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying oferculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of thestory."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,no one looks terribly heroic.Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. e obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as abrilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but thathe trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generalsdid not give him the real choices he was asking for. e wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, whatthe generals were giving him. e didn't get them. e wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down afterthey reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). Themilitary didn't provide him with that, either.As they say in Missouri, ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get whathe wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the Whiteouse who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task.  cut to the chase: Obama didn'tunderstand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president'swishes or they will be fired. publican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write thestrategy all by himself.This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clearenough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity topursue wars. Woodward has this right. ere are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president toldWoodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about itmore in terms of: Do you suessfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker atthe end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the  2011deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the wholeDemocratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White ouse aides:""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So, if he wanted such a plan, heshould have gotten such a plan. e is president after all.Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathomwell the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build uptheir arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's nota happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.breakAdThe White ouse clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing overnaughty things said about the White ouse to a reporter. Aording to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—andperhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, theusual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward aount that, I believe, he gets more wrong thanright. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the innersanctum for White ouse meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant istorian paints a picture of a war of all against all. Myinformation has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubtthat Secretary of State illary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almostalways quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like GeneralMcChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff RahmEmanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—inadvance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did asmuch. The day after his West Point speech last , where he set the firm date of  2011 to begin unspecifiedU.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,that everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to begoing. ere is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognizealso that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has beenenormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay afterit. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as muchto others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight onforever.Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. e's sworn to that time and again, and I believehim, despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward bookdemonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes tothis narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.Leslie .

SidUS ikers Were Seized in IraqBy Babak SarfarazPosted on  24, 2010, Printed on  22, 2010http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—Since their arrest last  by Iranian forces near the Iraqborder, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal andSarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakesdiplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranianauthorities have repeatedly aused the three of entering Iranto conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of thethree, along with the State Department, the Committee toProtect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared inThe Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spyingcharge and suggested that the Americans aidentally crossedthe border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in , Iran hasreleased little information about the circumstances of theirarrest or the status of their case.The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located twowitnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal andShourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — notin Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additionalsources report that the volutionary Guards officer wholikely ordered their detention has since been arrested oncharges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq calledZalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; theydeclined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranianforces, who have been known to conduct missions across theborder. The witnesses separately reported noticing the threeAmericans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormalregion, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain liesin Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers andoasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers outof curiosity, say that around 2 pm on  31, as the hikersdescended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward theIranian side using ""threatening"" and ""menacing"" gestures.When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round intothe air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walkeda few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,and apprehended them.These witness aounts corroborate a statement Bauer madeon  20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotelbetween the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Timesreported, Bauer ""denied that they had walked into Iran, asthey were aused of doing, before stopping himself andsaying, 'We can't really talk about that.""Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimedthat the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in across-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the DailyTelegraph in  2009. Lohoni said that his relatives hadseen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told theTelegraph that the hikers ""were targeted and captured by agroup that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to takeAmericans hostage at this sensitive time.""A State Department spokesman said that he had been unawareof evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory butwould not comment further.Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car tothe local headquarters of the Iranian volutionary Guards inMarivan, a town close to the border in the province ofKurdistan. When they arrived, aording to two sources, theAmericans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. eyvaTaab, then head of the volutionary Guards' intelligenceunit in the region. Aording to these sources — a formermember of the volutionary Guards and an official whoserves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taabwould have had the authority to order the Americans'detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of theIranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, thevolutionary Guards are responsible for maintainingnational security throughout the Islamic public.""When I heard the news that they had arrested Americanhikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of theintelligence arm of the volutionary Guards, because theyhave people in this region,"" says Idris Ahmedi, an IranianKurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholarat Georgetown University. ""I thought they were most likelylured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. Itis consistent with Iran's past actions.""Less than a month later, in late  2009, Taab himselfwas arrested and charged with the  6 murder of the son ofMostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma ( prayer leader) ofMarivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephewwas also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab hasbeen implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing aprofitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapesand kidnappings. Aording to the Sanandaj official,numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed againstTaab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping andmurder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and heawaits execution in a Tehran prison.Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported onTaab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in and  by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan VaKurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A 17 article describes Taab as the head of a ""criminalband"" and reports that Taab and seven aomplices wereunder arrest by the volutionary Guards for their role in avast number of illegal killings.Several sources describe Taab as the central power inKurdistan province. Aording to locals and experts, controlof the border lies in the hands of the volutionary Guards, inparticular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose localdivision had been commanded by Taab for about five years.""At this point it's really the Sepah, the volutionary Guards,that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,especially because the Americans are on the other side, inIraq,"" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor ofinternational studies at DePaul University and an Iran expertwho serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle Eastport. ""On the surface the security force [NAJA] is incharge, but it really is the volutionary Guards that controlthe borders.""It is a region where, aording to several Iran experts,smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iranborder is ""relatively porous because it's mountainous,"" saysFaraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at uman Rights Watch,which issued a report last year on political freedom in IranianKurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escaperoute for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocatesand Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade routefor goods. ""Smuggling is something that has taken place andcontinues to take place there, whether it be of goods or ofhumans across the border. It's something that happens quiteoften.""Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwesternquadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off theblack-market border economy. Aording to the Sanandajofficial and the former volutionary Guards officer, whohad firsthand knowledge of Taab's activities, Taab's firstscheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from pettysmugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goodsacross the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Timefor Drunken orses, which won the Camera d'Or at Cannesin 2000).The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalistgroups that have been demanding autonomy from the centralTehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life inKurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers'Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armedconflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terroristorganization by the United States and other governments.Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimedresponsibility for killing dozens of volutionary Guardssoldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, aswell as for the  2007 downing of an Iranian militaryhelicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, inWestern Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iraniansoldiers.It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militantsenjoy US support. In  2006, presentative DennisKucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whetherthe US government was ""fomenting opposition andsupporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groupsand Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom areoperating from Iraq."" Kucinich named two groups, includingPJAK. In  of that year, Seymour ersh reported inThe New Yorker that ""Israel and the United States have alsobeen working together in support of a Kurdish resistancegroup known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,"" and thata government consultant told him that the Israeli governmenthad provided ""equipment and training"" to PJAK.The United States and Israel have denied any involvementwith PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gainedsubstantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirdedTaab's decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well asthe repeated public charges of espionage against the three. Inearly , for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister eydarMoslehi told Iran's Press TV that ""it is quite obvious to usthat the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had linkswith Western and Israeli intelligence services.""The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdishmilitancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, insideIran and across the border in Iraq. In  2007, forexample, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attackedseveral villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on 4, officials in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region allegedthat ""a small unit of Iranian soldiers,"" including a tank andseveral other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile intoIraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran's counter-offensive. The former volutionary Guards officer says thatseveral current members of the Guards told him that Taab'sstated goal was to ""completely wipe out PJAK"" in hisjurisdiction. Aording to Alunedi, the scholar atGeorgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-borderassassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. TheKurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unitassassinated two Kurds on  15, 2008.Aording to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the pettyborder smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatallyshot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnapkoolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdishcivilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents andthen kill them—claiming they'd died in a military clash—inorder to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from hissuperiors in the volutionary Guards. e was assisted in thisplot by at least nine others, seven of whom have beenapprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews namedall seven, including aji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,identified as a ringleader.PJAK has officially denied involvement in these borderclashes, including in a  3, 2009, post to the Iranianwebsite Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen zai, aformer head of the volutionary Guards. Many of the PJAKclashes may, in fact, have been ""bogus,"" said the Sanandajofficial. ""More or less no clashes with PJAK have beenreported in the area since eyva Taab and his gang werebusted.""A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son'sdisappearance. She said he went missing the same day inearly 2009 that the government later claimed a clash withPJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a bordertown in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuitsagainst Taab; she asked that her name and location not bementioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.Taab's scheme was wildly suessful, aording to theSanandaj official, who said one bank aount under Taab'sname has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, whenTaab killed a local official's brother who was seeking work inthe area and, more decisively, last  when he killed thecleric's son.On  11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general ofIran's igh Council for uman Rights, said that thegovernment's investigation was nearly complete and a trialfor Bauer, Fattal and Shourd ""should not be very far fromnow."" In a statement issued on  17, the mothers of thehikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release theirchildren. ""Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not torelease them or move forward with a fair trial in which ourchildren can openly answer any allegations against them.""""These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers havebeen victims of political machinations and manipulation,""said adi Ghaemi, executive director of the InternationalCampaign for uman Rights in Iran. ""The fact that they havebeen held for so long without prosecution strongly supportsthis trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crimeand should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,who has studied the judicial files against them, hasconsistently maintained the only charge against them is illegalentry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention forso long. With this new information, even that charge appearsfabricated, and there is no basis for holding them.""As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and SarahShourd have been detained by Iran for ten months andtwenty-three days.This article was reported in collaboration with theInvestigative Fund at The Nation Institute.

GORDON and ANDREW W. LERENIran has aused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in  2009 and is still holding two ofthem in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day whenthe hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq saidthat the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers wereclose to the border but on the Iraqi side.The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, amountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when hisfriends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on  31.A  31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a ""female called him saying they were beingsurrounded by armed men.""At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Armydivision based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a ""kidnapping"" and said the threeAmerican tourists ""were being taken to the Iranian border.""The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained— all on the Iraqi side of the border.As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared tosupport the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraftwas sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forceswere sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force innorthern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens ""for being too close to the border."" The  reportreflects some frustration with the hikers for their ""lack of coordination"" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers somethoughts on the episode's broader implications.""The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internaldissension,"" it notes. ad the ument >>"

7194,7195,391,217,160.0,133,3,1,3,": Cheryl, Doug, JustinThere is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but Ithink it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what Ididn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clearlimitations.  say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,management, aountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quiteconceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my majortakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in thenear and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - Iwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife withgrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking mefirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.Thanks,ChelseaTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order ofimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:aitians want to help themselves and want the international community tohelp them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of theUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people Iencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been offLogbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant andincompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told meshe was waiting for the aitians to ""demand their political rights"" - whenthey're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)In fact, aitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structureshave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean MarieVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a headof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); awomen's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with asoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One ofthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head ofthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that thesecurity volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groupsof 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was lessimportant than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, theirsecond choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol atnight. Not the aitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). Theywanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and aountability.The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - arebeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulatetheir needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tentsand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious toanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlementresidents themselvesThe aitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit stilllargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both thenear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (whilerebuilding over next -5 years)The aitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enoughor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to aproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some ofwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about watersupplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French d Cross, Oxfam,IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., thelargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45ktoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and somewhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights atnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at nightwhile most sit in darkness)This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effectson the aitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanceditself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a daythe aitian Minister of ealth is now going once a week - because it was""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government'scurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process wasimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetingswere ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visibleconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOsby the aitian government and aitian people in the settlements. Theformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like veryfew actor(s) reliably show upAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelledaround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlementsor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WO; no evidence of OSA;no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers ridingaround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, Iasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port AuPrince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NOaessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTCOM but the""UN"" / OSA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less howmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks andcars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove byUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universallyacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, byaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of itsnarrowly defined agenda currently in aiti (vainations) and that itsreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and othercentral locationsThere is NO aountability in the UN system or internationalhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new newsbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., thereis no feedback mechanism for when the British d Cross dug the 34 of the40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when theywould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care ofthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the Britishd Cross should know better—at the least, the British d Crosssubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrinesThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, toput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into thesettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, forsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should havealready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to cleanlatrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be onsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZdrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When wewere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - itappeared - on rubble cleaning.: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically theresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting towork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of thecamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the IsraeliAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4settlements for at least the next month.The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which isprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable andgrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erraticin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now moresystematic and reliable in its food delivery. owever, it had not yetstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised fornext week.In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military onthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people seeguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces giventheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now arecovered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the aitiandoctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is alsogreat fear - at least from the aitian and ex-pat medical community-that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and totalorganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. TheUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts isnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns andseminarians. Catholic lief Services is present.Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of thisis familiar.):The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UNand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effectiveauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently thecollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I knowyou know this and are working on it. OSA clearly is failing on the ground,otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.owever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be asingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the groundorganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituentsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, projectmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-cutting (e.g., pay for work)There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow fromthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehousecoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person Italked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questionslike where can people evacuate to when it rains? ow will they aess foodand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could thoseplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanentstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate withrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, inthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistentwages until a 'market' could developThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of thesettlements at the minimumSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materialsin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there werecollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses justsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (aording tolocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects anoutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if theyand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surelypreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? Atthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au PrinceSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that havereceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the generalhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, havenow offered to rebuildolistically, all of the above should support the aitian government bothactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to helpaugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasibleThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partnerswhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, workwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if anysurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium termthat should aommodate a local dimension: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its missionshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could workon the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care fornon-earthquake related cases.: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is asuession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that theaitian government is comfortable with; currently aitian government/ atleast aitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea whatthe transfer plan is: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-experienced chaos on : mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinkingabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -but still unclear what the action plan is: aitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and weshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust andactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholicgroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessaryexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It wouldbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work: status, including mental health of workers there, both aitian andex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right nowFYI: Emergent aitian government plan of action, as I understand it:o Near term/ for the next year■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are notin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines inplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in orbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure securityand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);ensure medical care aessible; start schools at least for theyoungest children.▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worstgeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ otherreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the primeminister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlementselsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGOShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too closeto one another• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the abovediscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to gowhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key servicesonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid howto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical tosecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least2 murders in one camp on  night); what the right specof tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,school and what could be multipurpose; plan for olderchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial schoolplan; how to best support / help create where neededsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,who is in the settlements® Over next 6-12 months:o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for familiesto return to and subsequently encourage them to doso; government estimates this will be —30% of allhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., noevidence base)• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-existing villages around Port Au Prince wherefeasible to enable the government to move peopleout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move400-1000 families to each of these as neededo Longer-term:• built Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why peoplewould move back or what the government's post-rebuildvision looks like■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existedbefore the earthquake■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""ContextI spent the last four days in aiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners inealth (PI) the entire time - in Port Au Prince ,  and afternoon and at PI sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region and  morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Princewith: the aitian Minister of ealth Alex Larsen and his team; the aitiangovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaisonLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needsassessment) conference in New York at the end of  working on giving 'voice tothe voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voicesof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because ofCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNCR and others were represented; a group interested inbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were travelingwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PI - and the personwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PI,Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using tomove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to aiti. Informally, I talked with: people insettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local aitiandoctors; ex-pat PI and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hocresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us ournights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both onand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,head of PI in aiti, and others we met or ran into along the way."

I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks andcars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove byUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universallyacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, byaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of itsnarrowly defined agenda currently in aiti (vainations) and that itsreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and othercentral locationsThere is NO aountability in the UN system or internationalhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new newsbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., thereis no feedback mechanism for when the British d Cross dug the 34 of the40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when theywould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care ofthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the Britishd Cross should know better—at the least, the British d Crosssubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrinesThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, toput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into thesettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, forsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should havealready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to cleanlatrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be onsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZdrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When wewere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - itappeared - on rubble cleaning.: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically theresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting towork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of thecamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the IsraeliAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4settlements for at least the next month.The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which isprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable andgrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erraticin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now moresystematic and reliable in its food delivery. owever, it had not yetstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised fornext week.In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military onthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people seeguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces giventheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now arecovered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the aitiandoctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is alsogreat fear - at least from the aitian and ex-pat medical community-that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and totalorganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. TheUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts isnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns andseminarians. Catholic lief Services is present.Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of thisis familiar.):The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UNand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effectiveauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently thecollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I knowyou know this and are working on it. OSA clearly is failing on the ground,otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.owever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be asingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the groundorganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituentsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, projectmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-cutting (e.g., pay for work)There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow fromthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehousecoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person Italked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questionslike where can people evacuate to when it rains? ow will they aess foodand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could thoseplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanentstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate withrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, inthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistentwages until a 'market' could developThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of thesettlements at the minimumSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materialsin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there werecollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses justsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (aording tolocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects anoutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if theyand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surelypreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? Atthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au PrinceSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that havereceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the generalhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, havenow offered to rebuildolistically, all of the above should support the aitian government bothactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to helpaugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasibleThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partnerswhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, workwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if anysurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium termthat should aommodate a local dimension: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its missionshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could workon the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care fornon-earthquake related cases.: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is asuession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that theaitian government is comfortable with; currently aitian government/ atleast aitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea whatthe transfer plan is: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-experienced chaos on : mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinkingabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -but still unclear what the action plan is: aitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and weshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust andactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholicgroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessaryexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It wouldbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work: status, including mental health of workers there, both aitian andex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right nowFYI: Emergent aitian government plan of action, as I understand it:o Near term/ for the next year■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are notin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines inplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in orbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure securityand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);ensure medical care aessible; start schools at least for theyoungest children.■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worstgeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ otherreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the primeminister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlementselsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGOShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too closeto one another■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the abovediscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to gowhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key servicesonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid howto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical tosecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least2 murders in one camp on  night); what the right specof tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,school and what could be multipurpose; plan for olderchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial schoolplan; how to best support / help create where neededsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,who is in the settlements■ Over next 6-12 months:• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for familiesto return to and subsequently encourage them to doso; government estimates this will be —30% of allhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., noevidence base)• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-existing villages around Port Au Prince wherefeasible to enable the government to move peopleout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move400-1000 families to each of these as neededo Longer-term:■ built Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why peoplewould move back or what the government's post-rebuildvision looks like■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existedbefore the earthquake■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""ContextI spent the last four days in aiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners inealth (PI) the entire time - in Port Au Prince ,  and afternoon and at PI sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region and  morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Princewith: the aitian Minister of ealth Alex Larsen and his team; the aitiangovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaisonLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needsassessment) conference in New York at the end of  working on giving 'voice tothe voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voicesof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because ofCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNCR and others were represented; a group interested inbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were travelingwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PI - and the personwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PI,Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using tomove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to aiti. Informally, I talked with: people insettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local aitiandoctors; ex-pat PI and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hocresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us ournights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both onand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,head of PI in aiti, and others we met or ran into along the way."

At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Baileyutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats toovercome strong publican opposition to the bill.But today, all three publican senators voted against a motion toproceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that ""would furtherstrengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination."" Themotion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in theSenate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it wasapproved by the ouse, which passed the legislation again in 2009 withthe support of 10 publicans.Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts makefor the same work, but conservatives have invented a number ofludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, theeritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurtwomen because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required topay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed thatwomen would receive better compensation if they just had more""education and training."""

Sid0aptember 26, 2010John ntoul: The party voted for DavidMiliband but got the Panda insteadNew Labour leader won't stand a chance against DavidCameronThe result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. Theparty would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacyunchallenged.Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Partymembers, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. e is soft, cuddly andpanders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of whichhe was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, thethird runway for eathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he haddirect ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared toditch.But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itselfvoted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the ""New Labour Establishment"", in other words, the supposedly hatedBlairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in thegeneral election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board ny Blair's warning thatLabour lost because Gordon Brown ""moved a millimetre"" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument thatLabour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move acouple of centimetres further to the left.They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They knowthat the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They alsoknow that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protestparty, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the ouse of Commons in any event,is going to be roasted every week.Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of themembers on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in thecountry. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and thebeneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would haveteased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the partyactivists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the ""cork-popper"" candidate in Conservative Q. The waythings have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggledagainst Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back."

7502,7503,3961,0,17.0,736,3,1,3,"Diplomacy Before and After ConflictBy Marc GrossmanConflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in humanhistory, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has beentransformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend tobe timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each oasion new uses are found for oldweapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing.  be suessful, diplomats mustsimultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As ans Binnendijk andRichard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threatholds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of ourresponses.3The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security suesswill encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadestsimultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understandingPhilip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach tomodern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to producepreclusive victory will include conflict prevention, suessful negotiation, deterrence, thepreparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, andpromote political and economic pluralism after conflict.Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict andits aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy oupied much of my time at the StateDepartment from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassadorto Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State asAssistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for PoliticalAffairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations todiscuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed toprevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and thecontribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.Diplomacy and Conflict PreventionThanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methodsand theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the WoodrowWilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken aleadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the presentuncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any aeptedinternational conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed uponarrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilitiesare assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held aountable for theirresponsibilities.' e asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate andrationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks ofpreventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across differentorganizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by theUnited States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading internationalheadline. This suessful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkablepersonal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertsonand the EU igh presentative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a formerNATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary ColinPowell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the OhridFramework Agreement.As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights aboutmodern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need forpersonal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head offviolence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-centurydiplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriateforce quickly.'Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be UnavoidableWhen diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The newrequirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek toaddress the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable andimperative.The  1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show theworld that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid usingmilitary force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as AssistantSecretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the firstday or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to departRambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by notbeing present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from anoutcome that might be unaeptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was alsoprepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would beexhausted. er idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no furtherexcuses against taking military action.Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George .W. Bush hadconcluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign MinisterTariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoidingwar if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give theadministration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support forconflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, theadministration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offerturned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on  9, 1991. As Baker recounts,""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuessful and that within a matter ofdays, we would be at war.""8In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion fromAfghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam ussein was a dictator and amenace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus shouldbe kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraqhad been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginningof the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.Secretary of State enry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of theNixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is aconsciousness of what the other side will aept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait aparticular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as agood guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in theinteragency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the MiddleEast and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide toinstitutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagencydebate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermathassuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflictinto suessful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the springof 2003.The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard aass, observed that while he was""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time theylost out on a 60:40 decision.""' aass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons ofmass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against thewar.And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead totry to recreate the suessful Gulf War coalition of President George .W. Bush and argued thatthe United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of forcein the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to createa broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad internationalcoalition lost all relevance on  20, 2003, when the French government announced that itwould never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force inIraq.Diplomacy in Preparation for ConflictOnce conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support militarycommanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewestcasualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United Statespursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's supportof American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved thewhole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies.  pursue asuessful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight andsupport for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion ofAfghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surroundingAfghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the firsttime in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalitionforces before the  7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.Before the invasion of Iraq in  2003, and especially after  20, 2003, a similareffort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander Generalmmy Franks in order to make the war as short and suessful as possible and to limitAmerican, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with militarycommanders to seek aess to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the publicdiplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. Americandiplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort toconvince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northernfront in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about thesize of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with bothcivilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identifiedby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could notovercome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition tothe war.The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudesand actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to aresolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical levelour objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than theirterritory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In hisbook, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) andMinistry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over anumber of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?MOD: What do you want us to do?FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As apermanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.MOD: So you want us to use military force?FCO: Yes.MOD:  do what?  stop the killing?FCO: Yes. Exactly.MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe ontribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?FCO:  play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given ourdeployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.FCO: What do you suggest?MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority thanthese other tasks we are already undertaking?FCO: Probably not.MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we wantto speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the mostvaluable contribution.FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?MOD: ardly any.""Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated insomething like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, theissue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the Americancase, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the StateDepartment's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forcesin an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. nationalinterests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around theworld was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads tounderstandable consternation among those in uniform.Diplomacy and storing Stability Following ConflictThere are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits ofglobalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of suessful 21st-century diplomacy. Butgetting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may bethe most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of suess can be redefinedafter the fact, further complicating the assessment. Suessful democratic governance andeconomic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for timeand patience is a necessity on the ground. owever, patience is limited in home countries, and""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winnersand losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition inwhich the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek tocreate a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and othermeasures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if adecisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a conditionmay be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between amilitary operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying tocreate the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that atypical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas ofresponsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubicfoot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions betweeneach individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothingcomparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned byfunction rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my careerat the State Department.In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountainsbetween Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousandseach day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership ofAmbassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forcesand then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiatedOperation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to providehumanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, includingTurkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected thisarea from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard olbrooke recounts,some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in myresidence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of olbrooke's suessors as AssistantSecretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard andJames Dobbins to implement the Dayton Aords by applying whole-of-government efforts inpostconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary ofState for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, andnationbuilding in Kosovo.Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in aiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resourcesof the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space fordevelopment and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need tofocus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflictsociety. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan andIraq.The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall theprofound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, aboutwhether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush hadcampaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effortthe United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deploymentof U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers inthe Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, aiti, and theBalkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effectivelong-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece ofclassical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directedAmbassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in2001 to create a new Afghan government.  sueed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and putamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""BushAdministration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from othercountries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public securitythroughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact thatAfghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts ofU.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington aepted the diffusion ofresponsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reformingthe justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharingbut did not lead to suess. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States onAfghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even includingKosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the yearsfaced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planningfor postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned fromthe first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not havesolved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for theimmediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive ordercreating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled byothers in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, lookingback, the Coalition Provisional Authority aomplished a great deal under trying circumstancesis worth noting.23 On  1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and onbudget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to morecomprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to haveadequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency forInternational Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by AmbassadorJohn erbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for construction and Stabilization (S/CRS),his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stabilityoperations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.The Civilian sponse Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of areserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnelare anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public healthofficials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the activeand standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a coregroup of domestic U.S. Agencies.Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governmentsand the private sector. Between  2008 and  2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are nowat least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuildingcapacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, havehigher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a newpersonnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, ofcourse, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployedabroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially theeffort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about theexpeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small butsignificant number of people to serve suessfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.Experience with the Provincial construction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessonslearned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughestposts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The firstrequirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the CentralIntelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this specialcareer path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that aninvestment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now askdiplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve morethan one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet thesame age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Departmentcould allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as theyhave the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage thosewho desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. Thedepartment would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for acareer beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed forthe future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAIDcommitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answeredabout civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a StateDepartment—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonablecontingency fund? ow will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will thelines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be noquestion that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,development, and defense. Suess will come with clear direction and active implementation.If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: Whatnational policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create theconditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what wewill) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Aomplishing this task does nothave to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modernAmerican diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeablefuture, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building fromGermany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of theelements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in closecoordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to sueed.28 As PhilipBobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This pictureunfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peacebuilding by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzedindividually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not theanswer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smithwrites at the end of his volume:For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of thepeople and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course ofaction when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the statepossessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish acondition in which to achieve its political goal.  do this, military force is a valid option, alever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but tobe effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the onegoal.3°The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with theconsequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried outby well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed byeffective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to considerthese issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and thearvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. Theauthor also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of ni Getze, JillO'Donnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.ferences:William Zartman, Preventive Negotiation: Avoiding Conflict Escalation (Lanham, MD:Rovvman & Littlefield, 2001), 3.Rupert Smith, The Utility of Force: The Art of War in the Modern World (New York: VintageBooks, 2008), 19.ans Binnendijk and Richard L.

7546,7547,3985,0,4.0,737,3,1,3,"Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth readingA few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience withthe Middle East follow. Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is thatNetanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke withbelieved that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before itsexpiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of alarge majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given himleverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likudvoters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-statesolution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. e wants to keep him in the government for as long aspossible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima tokeep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. Aording to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into thegovernment now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious aboutnegotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning againstthe idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which showsKadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. Thelonger he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away tooppose him in the next elections.In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and thathe is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in thebelief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonableprice uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raisesdoubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the finalconcession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing nocredit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. Thiscombines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a realproblem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as helikes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined.  attempt tobroaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when directnegotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction ofmaking a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will furtherdelegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs PresidentObama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandlingrelations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advancethe future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to preventterror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation willdisappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. e considers it quite possible that if Bibidoesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now beenseriously damaged. e told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, butthat Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. Andplease forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for workingwith him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudgehim forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or aept his inflated demands.2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his ownpurposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that aeptedBibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly interms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all aboutAbu Mazen's politics.4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blameBibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiatedsolution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. TheIsraeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go andthey should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiationsand time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long aswe keep the door open. my staffer:AMAnne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy Planning of State(202) 647-2972"

The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for theState Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects theirstrategy and priorities.The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. BothClinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy, and Clintonsays the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to beimplemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring thatdevelopment undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around theworld will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'national security strategy,"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development wasto ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in  at the United NationsGeneral Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy,"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus onbuilding up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detaileverything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to thetypes and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.American diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit."

Gelb 30, 2010 I 10:42pmJulian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but theirrevelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, youclearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the mostdangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakersand diplomats are shown, quite aurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information fromforeign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on alliesand adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action withcowardice and hypocrisy.Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did hetoss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, andPresident amid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""?  save the world? Not a chance. e did it to get attention, andhe got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. DidAssange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by thehair on your chinny chin chin. e did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopelessleft-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time tocome. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went outand told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucialworld In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.is aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are reallydoing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what wasplain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strangecommentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here'swhat you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the frontpages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and Americandiplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil andgas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If theworld wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.—The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iranthrough China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.ally creepy.—Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. e wants todiminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president isa harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away thepolitical cover of Yemen's leaders.—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searchingdesperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the KoreanPeninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinesethinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights ofU.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it ornot, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at youin these materials.So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat tochoose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that isnecessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, ortelling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government isconcocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need forserious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserveconfidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.Leslie .

7764,7765,762,0,9.0,747,3,1,3,Update from phil
7765,7766,4069,0,51.0,747,3,1,3,"ere is the publican former Secretaries of State op ed, which ran in today's wash post.The publican case for ratifying New STARTbn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnewsBy enry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell,  2, 2010;publican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. Thatis why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald agan and George .W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I andSTART II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognizedthat reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclearcatastrophe and increase the stability of America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the RussianFederation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and RussianPresident Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expiredalmost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the UnitedStates to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.Along with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around theworld. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty aresufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, thechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by apublican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for theadministration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, asprevious nuclear arms treaties did.Although each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonableanswers. We believe there are compelling reasons publicans should support ratification.First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Sincethe original START expired last , Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changesin its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day,America's understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from nationalsecurity tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight intoRussia's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrentmission.Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our militarycommanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Althoughthe treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballisticmissiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective thanbuilding new ones for defense purposes.Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential tomaintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratificationprocess. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department'snuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originallyproposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona publican who has been vigilant inthis effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring thatour nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes notfrom Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fallinto the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russiamatters. It matters because it is in both parties' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategicnuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress inrolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work tosecure ""loose nukes"" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation inAfghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism.Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must beconsidered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we shouldconsider the ramifications of not ratifying it.Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. Thereare plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipatesignificant conflict between Democrats and publicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify NewSTART.The writers were secretaries of state for the past five publican presidents.UnsubscribeThe White ouse • 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW • Washington DC 20500 • 202-456-1111"

7788,7789,4081,0,7.0,748,3,1,3,"sbwhoeop,  3, 2010 9:55 AM: Roger Cohen in NYT: ""American Diplomacy vealed — as Good""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hp 2, 2010American Diplomacy vealed as GoodBy ROGER COENNEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informedand dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is nowcondemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if theircorrespondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should giveevery journalist pause.So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the moreconspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will beadded.Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallowspectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunnileaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictionson when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of theChinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women andSilvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short onembarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down tothe familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,""""monarch-like.""I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for thisunderreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""Whilewe don't know nor might not ever know the real  12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levelsand that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'wonbig' in the first round.""It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehranduring the election and its violent aftermath.A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are aboutTehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the UnitedStates. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the MiddleEast more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreachsuggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinkingabout balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.The cables reveal that as early as  2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that""engagement alone is unlikely to sueed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never havebeen overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, heexpressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement thatleaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, inAssange's words, would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relationto Iran.Ituh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option healso favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! e's all over the place.What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? e's aloose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp ofdiscovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to thecourageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive."

7832,7833,4094,0,7.0,749,3,1,3,"sbwhoeop,  : Kathleen on Palin on JFK. SidB6Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion andpoliticsBy Kathleen Kennedy wnsend,  3, 2010; 6:00 PMSarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.In her new book, ""America by eart,"" Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater ouston MinisterialAssociation, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, byhis views rather than his faith. ""Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,""Kennedy said. ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.""Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had ""sueeded in the best possibleway: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either."" Now, however, she says she has revisited thespeech and changed her mind. She finds it ""defensive . . . in tone and content"" and is upset that Kennedy, rather thanpresenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an ""unequivocal divorce of the two.""Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be noreligious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such atest. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who wouldnot.If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be ""reconciled."" My uncle urgedthat religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention wouldlead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters anddemean their opponents.Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblanceof a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war andpeace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which churchthey belonged to.But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not ""telling thecountry how his faith had enriched him."" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the pathmy uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be ""neither imposed by him upon thenation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.""After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, ""rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing servicesand education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools."" Shedoes not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used inparochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But hewisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Taxmoney should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008publican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of ""how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I wereelected."" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies ""intent onestablishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.""""There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,"" Romney said. ""What do I believe about Jesus Christ?""Romney, of course, is a Mormon. e answered the question, proclaiming that ""Jesus Christ is the son of God.""Palin praises Romney for delivering a ""thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith inAmerican public life."" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled torespond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. spectfor the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questionsshould not play a role in political campaigns.Palin contends that Kennedy sought to ""run away from religion."" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what madeAmerica so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law thatfaith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured thosewhose religious beliefs differed from their own. demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines theprecise reason that America is exceptional.Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal theirbeliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes p. NancyPelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for ""talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.""Who is Palin to say what God's ""walk"" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, ""But letus judge not that we not be judged."" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, infealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in ouston that he would resign if his religion everinterfered with his duty as president.My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. is brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sisterdied in a plane crash soon after the war. e suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PTboat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. is God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.America's first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:.:1,rai.adc'res and invoked the Bible'scommand to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We areconfronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.""Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles' and my father's dedication to justice. My father,Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled ""Suppose God Is -Black."" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that hetook positions ""directly at odds with his Catholic faith.""Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. e did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy attimes. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bringabout those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who woulddisagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousnessand contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his ouston speech.Palin, for her part, argues that ""morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs."" That statementamounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard wouldsupport such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunctionthat Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show ""malice toward none, with charity for ail.""Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earthprecisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full ouston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Orshe may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-won ideal of religious freedom that is among our country's greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in ouston,that is the ""kind of America I believe in.""Kathleen Kennedy wnsend is a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and the author of ""Failing America's Faithful:ow day's Churches Are Mixing God With Politics and Losing Their Wav.""

7849,7850,4103,0,51.0,752,3,1,3,"OPINION DECEMBER 7, 2010New Start: Ratify, With CaveatsThe treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear toMoscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.By CONDOLEEZZA RICEWhen U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclearthreat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in thewake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United Statesand Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishmentof a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The realthreat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerousregimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states alsopursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United Statesand our allies.It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain atriad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfullyreinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty lastyear.Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents agan and George .W. Bush, and itsreinstatement is crucial.Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if thetreaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona hasled a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department ofEnergy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fullyfund the president's program.Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defensestrategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephenadley.Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold Warlink between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the""interrelationship"" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will notlimit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are aeptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remainfully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing bothpotential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russiansneed to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability tointercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by ourmissile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recentlybetween NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in theKremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia's unstable south—are dangerous.That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat fromtactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russiaknows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in itsinterest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and itslongstanding concern about Pyongyang.The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for along time.After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. andRussian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclearsecurity (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the NewStart treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record ofratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year.Ms. Rice, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanford'soover Institution, was U.S. national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and U.S. secretary of state from 2005 to 2009."

7875,7876,4121,13,7.0,755,3,1,3,"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/bitter-new-washington/The New York view of BooksIn the Bitter New Washington 23, 2010•;izaibeth O wOf course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, asWalter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of ""those idiot boards""—the TelePrompters on which the greatorator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to aanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after theObamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook afew hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people werehurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but atthe same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. er wardrobe seemsquite extensive for these troubled times.)Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, someof whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience ingoverning. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word thathe offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol ill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in thefirst two years—""I can handle them,"" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of theWhite ouse's new determination to ""reach out."" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore theywould ""reach out,"" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is thatsomeone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be""comfortable.""For example, rn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by allaounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon'sbeing given his new position was that ""the President is comfortable with him."" Just as Obama is described as pleased withhimself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to thosewho had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White ouse in the first two years has been that therewere no ""grown-ups"" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as ""not one of ours."" JoeBiden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the Whiteouse....Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. Thefact that the Obama White ouse has been so poor at ""messaging"" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he hadno overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White ouse aideabout this, he pointed to what had been billed as a ""major speech on the economy,"" at Georgetown University in 2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of bothObama and his top staff. An ally says, ""You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know whereyou're going."" Another says, ""They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White ouse.""Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. is 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all overthe place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that weshouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was makingeconomic, progress.So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded hisswearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there whowere not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he wasdoing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010campaign....More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying todefend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on  21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:""Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got theadvertising properly about what was going on."" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who wasgenerally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, ""Bullocks! What policies?"")The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care(with strong participation by White ouse aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his patheticpress conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn'treally understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, ""Their definition ofgoverning is passing bills."" Someone else relatively close to the White ouse explained that since Obama had been socriticized for being ""arrogant"" and ""aloof,"" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (""And I take responsibility for that,""Obama said again and again.)"

But I would justurge you also to speak from the heart -- you know what this is reallly about better than anyone and if your passion formaking this happen and commitment to getting it done come through, it will frame the entire exercise. This is your onlychance to speak to the press about 14 months of work until we relaunch in .

Rubin, a former assistant secretary ofstate under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.got 15, 2010loomberg to Publish EditorialsBy ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.SBeing mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.The mayor's company, 3loomber,,3 L.P., said on  that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast mediaenterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has anagreement with the city to have no involvement in the ""day-to-day operations"" of his company, the endeavor, calledBloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.""I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with thevalues and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,"" said Matthew Winkler, the editor inchief of Bloomberg News. ""I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people tocome away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.""The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yetanother potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues thatcollide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg hasa direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would notavoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from timeto time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.""I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,"" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's oasionalinvolvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain atarm's length from the company.A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.""Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,"" he said.As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorialpage is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On , Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run forpresident.)The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including BloombergBusinessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders andbusinesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary ofstate under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary inthe blogosphere.But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than twoyears ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting aneditorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy aording to their personal views is an oldone in American journalism. William Randolph earst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signededitorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.""e's aepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,"" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the CityUniversity of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of earst. ""This is what we all do. We try to persuade therest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.""Mr. Winkler said: ""There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literallyseize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result withreporting.""""That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, thecompany, that it should take advantage of,"" Mr. Winkler added.Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy ofaomplishment.Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation thatwill eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about governmentservices and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital."

7937,7938,4170,0,2.0,686,3,1,3,"TE NBC/YORKER 14, 2010The EnvoyPosted by endrik ertzbergLast night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friendapproached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth ofa holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard olbrooke died,"" she said.Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on —critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—thissudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard olbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything abouthim was large: his physical size, including the ultimate ""in your face"" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-sawvoice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, fordanger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). ewas no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particularwars. e was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.Unlike my tearful informant, who had known olbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with himin the casual way of many journalists and editors. e was a peer as well as a ""source,"" a prolific and forceful writer whosefavorite venues, The New public and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. e wasgregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on  1st, at theNew York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been onhis feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. e still had plenty to do.Not long after olbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked himif he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" e said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. Afterthat, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when heneeds a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become theSecretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, olbrooke has left a stronger, morepositive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. e certainly did not die of a brokenheart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment thatbrought on the rending of his aorta. e died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to bethe most important he ever spoke.Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Imagesad morehttp://www. newyo rker. corn/on line/b log s/hend ri khe rtzberq/20 10/1 2/ho lb rooke. htm 1?p ri ntab le=true#ixzz1 8jNL4kn"
